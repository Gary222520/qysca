Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users'' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. '"This License'" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. '"Copyright'" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. '"The Program'" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". '"Licensees'" and '"recipients'" may be individuals or organizations. To '"modify'" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a '"modified version'" of the earlier work or a work '"based on'" the earlier work. A '"covered work'" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To '"propagate'" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To '"convey'" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays '"Appropriate Legal Notices'" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1\. Source Code. The '"source code'" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. '"Object code'" means any non-source form of a work. A '"Standard Interface'" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The '"System Libraries'" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A '"Major Component'", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The '"Corresponding Source'" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work''s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2\. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3\. Protecting Users'' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work''s users, your or third parties'' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non- permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to '"keep intact all notices'". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to- peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A '"User Product'" is either (1) a '"consumer product'", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, '"normally used'" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. '"Installation Information'" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7\. Additional Terms. '"Additional permissions'" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non- permissive additional terms are considered '"further restrictions'" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8\. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An '"entity transaction'" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party''s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11\. Patents. A '"contributor'" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor''s '"contributor version'". A contributor''s '"essential patent claims'" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, '"control'" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor''s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a '"patent license'" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To '"grant'" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. '"Knowingly relying'" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient''s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is '"discriminatory'" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12\. No Surrender of Others'' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13\. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14\. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy''s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15\. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16\. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the '"copyright'" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. Copyright (C) This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see . Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a '"Source'" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to which it applies (the “Work”), either as-is or in modified form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

2. Receiving a License
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

2.1. Application
The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by You that contain any licenseable portion of the Work (a “Modified Work”). Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

2.2. Offer and Acceptance
This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by Licensor.

2.3. Compliance and Remedies
Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via specific performance.

3. Permissions and Conditions

3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject; and

b) Take any action with the Work that would infringe any patent claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as distributed by Licensor.

3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted
The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section 3.1:

a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor, directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other software or hardware.

b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

4. Conditions
If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a “Recipient”), either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the following conditions:

4.1. Provide Access to Source Code
Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code corresponding to the Work.

The “Source Code” of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making modifications, including any comments, configuration information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code
Network access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one year thereafter.

4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work
Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be distributed together as a single work.

4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities
You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the “Embargo Period”) if:

a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees, and

d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

4.2. Maintain User Autonomy
In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to interfere with a Recipient’s ability to fully use an independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient’s own User Data.

“User Data” means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

4.2.1. No Withholding User Data
Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient’s User Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access
You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient’s ability to access any functionality present in Recipient’s independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the Recipient’s User Data.

4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access
You may not contractually restrict a Recipient’s ability to independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution
You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in the Source Code (the “Notices”), and provide all such Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.

4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License
You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.

4.5. Combined Work Exception
As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the “Combined Work Exception,” or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a “Larger Work.” So long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient’s ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the terms of your choice.

5. Term and Termination
The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor’s intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first (“Term”). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

5.1. Effect of Termination
If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor or an intended third party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

5.3. Termination Due to Litigation
If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due to litigation.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability
As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.

7. Other Provisions

7.1. Affiliates
An “Affiliate” means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law
A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.

7.3. No Sublicensing
This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients’ exercise of the permissions granted herein.

7.4. Attorneys’ Fees
In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages relating thereto, including by an intended third party beneficiary, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A “prevailing party” is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

7.5. No Waiver
Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor’s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

7.6. Severability
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will remain in full force and effect.

7.7. License for the Text of this License
The text of this license is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that any modifications of this license may not use the name “Cryptographic Autonomy License” or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe any derived work of this License."
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00003,BSD-Protection,BSD Protection License,https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-Protection.html,f,f,t,high,该协议不包含实质性的限制条款,f,-,[],[],[],[],"BSD Protection License February 2002 Preamble -------- The Berkeley Software Distribution ('"BSD'") license has proven very effective over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is arguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint. This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network models). With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the continued success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion of a few lines of '"GPL-tainted'" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and given that further work will likely build upon the '"tainted'" portions, making them difficult to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such '"GPL-taint'". In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor. While under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution. For the above reasons, we put forth this '"BSD Protection License'": A license designed to retain the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both non-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that freedom. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow. BSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION ---------------------------------------------------------------- 0. Definitions. a) '"Program'", below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this license. b) A '"work based on the Program'", below, refers to either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law. c) '"Modification'", below, refers to the act of creating derivative works. d) '"You'", below, refers to each licensee. 1. Scope. This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program. Other activities are outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program. 2. Verbatim copies. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 3. Modification and redistribution under closed license. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the following conditions: a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed. b) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in order that it may not be confused with the original work. c) The license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly prohibit the distribution of further derivative works. 4. Modification and redistribution under open license. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the following conditions: a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed. b) You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any changes made to the Program. The full details need not necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided that each modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are included on where the full details of the modifications may be found. c) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 5. Implied acceptance. You may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except as expressly provided under this license. Consequently, any such action will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this license. 6. NO WARRANTY. THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

All rights reserved. NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care. Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country. 0. Subject Matter This License applies to the computer program known as '"Aladdin Ghostscript.'" The '"Program'", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the '"Licensor'"). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as '"GNU Ghostscript'" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc. A '"work based on the Program'" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification. BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM. 1. Licenses. Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program: (a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium. (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium. 2. Restrictions. This license is subject to the following restrictions: (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program '"without charge'"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction: (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.) (ii) Distributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.) (b) Activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). (c) You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof ('"the Work'"): (i) If you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the Program''s files and the date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the change; (ii) You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License; (iii) If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an '"About box'", the Work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print an announcement.); (iv) You must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so; (v) If you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and written instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on the distribution medium; (vi) You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient''s exercise of the rights granted herein. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code. 3. Reservation of Rights. No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 4. Other Restrictions. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 5. Limitations. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU '"AS IS,'" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 6. General. This License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules. If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected. For United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply: If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense ('"DOD'"), the Program and its documentation are classified as '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation'" respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation are classified as '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation'" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License."

Definitions: Throughout this License, '"Font'" means the TrueType fonts '"AR PL Mingti2L Big5'", '"AR PL KaitiM Big5'" (BIG-5 character set) and '"AR PL SungtiL GB'", '"AR PL KaitiM GB'" (GB character set) which are originally distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table. '"PL'" means '"Public License'". '"Copyright Holder'" means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the Font. '"You'" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font. '"Freely Available'" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this service. 1. Copying & Distribution You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies. 2. Modification You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions are met: a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when you changed that file. b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software interchange. c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. Condition Subsequent You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 4. Acceptance You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions. 5. Automatic Receipt Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 6. Contradiction If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 7. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 8. DAMAGES WAIVER UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users'' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. '"This License'" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. '"Copyright'" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. '"The Program'" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". '"Licensees'" and '"recipients'" may be individuals or organizations. To '"modify'" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a '"modified version'" of the earlier work or a work '"based on'" the earlier work. A '"covered work'" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To '"propagate'" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To '"convey'" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays '"Appropriate Legal Notices'" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1\. Source Code. The '"source code'" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. '"Object code'" means any non-source form of a work. A '"Standard Interface'" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The '"System Libraries'" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A '"Major Component'", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The '"Corresponding Source'" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work''s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2\. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3\. Protecting Users'' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work''s users, your or third parties'' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non- permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to '"keep intact all notices'". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to- peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A '"User Product'" is either (1) a '"consumer product'", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, '"normally used'" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. '"Installation Information'" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7\. Additional Terms. '"Additional permissions'" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non- permissive additional terms are considered '"further restrictions'" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8\. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An '"entity transaction'" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party''s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11\. Patents. A '"contributor'" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor''s '"contributor version'". A contributor''s '"essential patent claims'" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, '"control'" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor''s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a '"patent license'" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To '"grant'" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. '"Knowingly relying'" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient''s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is '"discriminatory'" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12\. No Surrender of Others'' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13\. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 14\. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy''s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15\. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16\. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the '"copyright'" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. Copyright (C) This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see . Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a '"Source'" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a '"copyright disclaimer'" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see . "

Definitionen a. Der Begriff '"Abwandlung'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff '"Sammelwerk'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. '"Verbreiten'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Der '"Lizenzgeber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. '"Rechteinhaber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. f. Der Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit '"Sie'" bzw. '"Ihne*'" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter '"Öffentlich Zeigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. i. '"Vervielfältigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ('"unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann'"): a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt; c. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten; d. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ('"nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung'", '"Non-commercial-Option'"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. c. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ('"Zuschreibungsempfänger'"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. d. Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. f. Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. d. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) und b) angeboteten Lizenzen aus. f. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons ist nicht Partei dieser Lizenz und übernimmt keinerlei Gewähr oder dergleichen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand.

'"LICENSED WORK'" AND '"RECIPIENT'" ARE DEFINED BELOW. IMPORTANT NOTE: This License is '"adaptive'", and the generic version or another version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine your rights and obligations under this License. You must read the specific Adaptive Public License that you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain terms are defined at the outset by the Initial Contributor. See Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying this License to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this License. For example, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of law and jurisdiction see Part 3 of Exhibit A; (b) for the selected definition of Third Party see Part 4 of Exhibit A; and (c) for selected patent licensing terms (if any) see Section 2.2 below and Part 6 of Exhibit A. 1. DEFINITIONS. 1.1. '"CONTRIBUTION'" means: (a) In the case of the Initial Contributor, the Initial Work distributed under this License by the Initial Contributor; and (b) In the case of each Subsequent Contributor, the Subsequent Work originating from and distributed by such Subsequent Contributor. 1.2. '"DESIGNATED WEB SITE'" means the web site having the URL identified in Part 1 of Exhibit A, which URL may be changed by the Initial Contributor by posting on the current Designated Web Site the new URL for at least sixty (60) days. 1.3. '"DISTRIBUTOR'" means any Person that distributes the Licensed Work or any portion thereof to at least one Third Party. 1.4. '"ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM'" means any mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data. 1.5. '"EXECUTABLE'" means the Licensed Work in any form other than Source Code. 1.6. '"GOVERNING JURISDICTION'" means the state, province or other legal jurisdiction identified in Part 3 of Exhibit A. 1.7. '"INDEPENDENT MODULE'" means a separate module of software and/or data that is not a derivative work of or copied from the Licensed Work or any portion thereof. In addition, a module does not qualify as an Independent Module but instead forms part of the Licensed Work if the module: (a) is embedded in the Licensed Work; (b) is included by reference in the Licensed Work other than by a function call or a class reference; or (c) must be included or contained, in whole or in part, within a file directory or subdirectory actually containing files making up the Licensed Work. 1.8. '"INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR'" means the Person or entity identified as the Initial Contributor in the notice required by Part 1 of Exhibit A. 1.9. '"INITIAL WORK'" means the initial Source Code, object code (if any) and documentation for the computer program identified in Part 2 of Exhibit A, as such Source Code, object code and documentation is distributed under this License by the Initial Contributor. 1.10.

'"SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR'" means any Person that makes or contributes to the making of any Subsequent Work and that distributes that Subsequent Work to at least one Third Party. 1.18. '"SUBSEQUENT WORK'" means a work that has resulted or arises from changes to and/or additions to: (a) the Initial Work; (b) any other Subsequent Work; or (c) to any combination of the Initial Work and any such other Subsequent Work; where such changes and/or additions originate from a Subsequent Contributor. A Subsequent Work will '"originate'" from a Subsequent Contributor if the Subsequent Work was a result of efforts by such Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such Subsequent Contributor''s behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is engaged by or under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For greater certainty, a Subsequent Work expressly excludes and shall not capture within its meaning any Independent Module. 1.19. '"SUPPLEMENT FILE'" means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a file name '"suppfile.txt'". 1.20. '"THIRD PARTY'" has the meaning assigned in Part 4 of Exhibit A. 2. LICENSE. 2.1.

PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS. (a) This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any patent license (the '"PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE'"). (b) However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License which includes a patent license (the '"PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE'") by selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such future copies under this License. (c) If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license. (d) Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. 2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER. Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Work. 2.4. RESERVATION. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein. 3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. 3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY. (a) A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor''s Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor''s Subsequent Work. (b) All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in a file called '"license.txt.'" In addition, the License Notice in Part 5 of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the Licensed Work. 3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK. A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an '"EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION'") to any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or (b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months. For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination. 3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS. When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution. 3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE. Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. 3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS. Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient''s own corporation or organization (collectively, '"INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS'"). The Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive. 3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES. This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements. 3.7. LARGER WORKS. Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work. 3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS. (a) Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works. (b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the '"EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS'") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the '"NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS'") for documenting such changes. (c) Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an '"Earlier LICENSED COPY'") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements. (d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work. (e) An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License. 3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME. The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior written permission. 3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR. (a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor''s attribution information must occur (the '"ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION'"). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the '"ATTRIBUTION LIMITS'"). (b) If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial Contributor. (c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License. 3.11. For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect. 4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY. 4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES. A Recipient ('"COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT'") may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, '"SERVICES'") to one or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that Commercial Recipient''s own behalf, and not on behalf of any other Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)). 4.2. INDEMNITY. Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor ('"COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR'") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an '"INDEMNIFIED PARTY'") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively '"LOSSES'") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. 5.1. NEW VERSIONS. The Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS. Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work 6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS DISCLAIMER. 6.2. RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 7. TERMINATION. 7.1. This License shall continue until terminated in accordance with the express terms herein. 7.2. Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time. 7.3. This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach. Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this License. 7.4. Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient under a copy of this License (in each case, an '"Other License'" and in plural, '"Other Licenses'") shall survive any such termination of this License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 7.5. Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination. 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND/OR AGENTS (AS THE CASE MAY BE), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, INDIRECT DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, OR ANY OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK OR ANY PART THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THAT RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) IN RELATION TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8.1. 8.2. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, EACH RECIPIENT SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 9. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL ACTION. 9.1. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York. 9.2. The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality, validity, existence and enforceability of this License. Each party to this License hereby irrevocably attorns to and accepts the jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing Jurisdiction for such purposes. 9.3. Except as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, in the event of any action or proceeding brought by any party against another under this License the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable. 10. MISCELLANEOUS. 10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the benefit of the Initial Contributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Contributor and/or any other Recipient may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against any Recipient. 10.2. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof, and supersedes and cancels all previous oral and written communications, representations, agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 10.3. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 10.4. The language in all parts of this License shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 10.5. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 10.6. The paragraph headings of this License are for reference and convenience only and are not a part of this License, and they shall have no effect upon the construction or interpretation of any part hereof. 10.7. Each of the terms '"including'", '"include'" and '"includes'", when used in this License, is not limiting whether or not non-limiting language (such as '"without limitation'" or '"but not limited to'" or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto. 10.8. The parties hereto acknowledge they have expressly required that this License and notices relating thereto be drafted in the English language. //***THE LICENSE TERMS END HERE (OTHER THAN AS SET OUT IN EXHIBIT A).***// EXHIBIT A (to the Adaptive Public License) PART 1: INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR AND DESIGNATED WEB SITE The Initial Contributor is: ____________________________________________________ [Enter full name of Initial Contributor] Address of Initial Contributor: ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ [Enter address above] The Designated Web Site is: __________________________________________________ [Enter URL for Designated Web Site of Initial Contributor] NOTE: The Initial Contributor is to complete this Part 1, along with Parts 2, 3, and 5, and, if applicable, Parts 4 and 6.

Is this a Patents-Included License pursuant to Section 2.2 of the License? YES [ ] NO [ ] By default, if YES is not selected by the Initial Contributor, the answer is NO. A. For the purposes of the paragraphs in this Part 6 of Exhibit A, '"LICENSABLE'" means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights granted herein. B. The Initial Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by the Initial Contributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of such Initial Work or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph B by the Initial Contributor: (1) for any code that the Initial Contributor deletes from the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Initial Contributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Initial Work (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Initial Contributor. C. Effective upon distribution by a Subsequent Contributor to a Third Party of any Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor, such Subsequent Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by such Subsequent Contributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of any such Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor alone and/or in combination with its Subsequent Work (or portions of such combination) to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, export, transfer and otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor with its Subsequent Work (or portions of such combination); (collectively and in each case, the '"SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR VERSION'"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph C by such Subsequent Contributor: (1) for any code that such Subsequent Contributor deletes from the Subsequent Contributor Version (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Subsequent Contributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Subsequent Contributor Version (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Subsequent Contributor Version (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Subsequent Contributor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph D by such Distributor: (1) for any code that such Distributor deletes from the Distributor Version (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Distributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Distributor Version (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Distributor Version (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Distributor. E.

The termination shall be effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from User to Recipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent litigation claim before the end of the ninety (90) day period. To be effective, any such notice of license termination must include a specific list of applicable patents and/or a copy of the copyrighted work of User that User alleges will be infringed by Recipient upon License termination.

Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero''s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author''s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone''s free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License. The '"Program'", below, refers to any such program or work, and a '"work based on the Program'" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term '"modification'".) Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: * a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. * c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) * d) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program''s complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work. These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and '"any later version'", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc. You may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the Free Software Foundation''s GNU General Public License version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

Licence THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ('"CCPL'" OR '"LICENCE'"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. This Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence enables You (all capitalised terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and distribute Works worldwide, under the terms of this licence, provided that You credit the Original Author. ''The Licensor'' [one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence] and ''You'' agree as follows: 1. Definitions a. '"Attribution'" means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and have rights in the Work or Collective Work under this Licence. b. '"Collective Work'" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with a number of other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective whole. c. '"Derivative Work'" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence. d. '"Licence'" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence agreement. e. '"Licence Elements'" means the following high-level licence attributes indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike. f. '"Non-Commercial'" means '"not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or private monetary compensation'". The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. g. '"Original Author'" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work. h. '"Work'" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence. For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number. 2. Licence Terms 2.1 The Licensor hereby grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for Non-Commercial use and for the duration of copyright in the Work. You may: • copy the Work; • create one or more Derivative Works; • incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works; • copy Derivative Works or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work; and • publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work or the Work as incorporated in any Collective Work, to the public in any material form in any media whether now known or hereafter created. HOWEVER, You must not: • impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Derivative Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alter or restrict the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights; • impose any digital rights management technology on the Work or the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work that alters or restricts the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those rights; • sublicense the Work; • subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. FINALLY, You must: • make reference to this Licence (by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media used) on all copies of the Work and Collective Works published, distributed, performed or otherwise disseminated or made available to the public by You; • recognise the Licensor''s / Original Author''s right of attribution in any Work and Collective Work that You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used; and • to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Additional Provisions for third parties making use of the Work 2.2. Further licence from the Licensor Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate • the Work; or • any Derivative Work; or • the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Work on the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder. 2.3. Further licence from You Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate • a Derivative Work; or • a Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work You agree to offer to the relevant third party making use of the Work (in either of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the Derivative Work on any of the following premises: • a licence on the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You hereunder; or • a later version of the licence granted to You hereunder; or • any other Creative Commons licence with the same Licence Elements. 2.4. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement. 2.5. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to, the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a licensing body, such as a collecting society, royalties for any use of the Work which results in commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 3. Warranties and Disclaimer Except as required by law, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an '"as is'" and '"as available'" basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied. 4. Limit of Liability Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the Licensor shall not be liable and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage howsoever and whenever caused to You. 5. Termination The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those Licences. 6. General 6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or unenforceable. 6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication in any form. 6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms. 6.4. This Licence shall be governed by the law of England and Wales and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales. 7. On the role of Creative Commons 7.1. Neither the Licensor nor the User may use the Creative Commons logo except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the Creative Commons trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the Creative Commons trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative Commons website or be otherwise available upon request from time to time. 7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or user of the Licence. 7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting to use or using this Licence. 7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence, and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the Licensor''s or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability. 7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION''S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM THE LICENSOR TO YOU. Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark '"Creative Commons'" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

Definitionen a. Der Begriff '"Abwandlung'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff '"Sammelwerk'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. '"Verbreiten'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Der '"Lizenzgeber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. '"Rechteinhaber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. f. Der Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit '"Sie'" bzw. '"Ihnen'" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter '"Öffentlich Zeigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. i. '"Vervielfältigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ('"unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann'"): a. den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Weitergehende Änderungen oder Abwandlungen sind jedoch untersagt. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ('"nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung'", '"Non-commercial-Option'"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. c. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ('"Zuschreibungsempfänger'"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. d. Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.b) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. f. Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die den Schutzgegenstand enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. c. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. d. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind. Rechtsgeschäftliche Änderungen des Verhältnisses zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen sind nur über Modifikationen dieser Lizenz möglich. Der Lizenzgeber ist an etwaige zusätzliche, einseitig durch Sie übermittelte Bestimmungen nicht gebunden. Diese Lizenz kann nur durch schriftliche Vereinbarung zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber modifiziert werden. Derlei Modifikationen wirken ausschließlich zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen und wirken sich nicht auf die Dritten gemäß Ziffern 8.a) angeboteten Lizenzen aus. e. Sofern zwischen Ihnen und dem Lizenzgeber keine anderweitige Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und soweit Wahlfreiheit besteht, findet auf diesen Lizenzvertrag das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland Anwendung.

The following bodies are the authors of the license CeCILL[1](http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL_V1-US.html#sdfootnote1sym): Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique – CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15. Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique – CNRS, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16. Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique– INRIA, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex. ## PREAMBLE The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an “open source” distribution model. The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations. Nevertheless, access to the source code, and the resulting rights to copy, modify and redistribute only provide users with a limited warranty and the software’s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability. In this respect, the user’s attention is drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user in light of its specific status of free software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth IT knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software’s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions as regards security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions. ### Article 1 - DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this Agreement, when the following expressions commence with a capital letter, they shall have the following meaning: Agreement: means this Licensing Agreement, and any or all of its subsequent versions. Software: means the software in its Object Code and/or Source Code form and, where applicable, its documentation, “as is” at the time when the Licensee accepts the Agreement. Initial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and/or Object Code form and, where applicable, its documentation, “as is” at the time when it is distributed for the first time under the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Modified Software: means the Software modified by at least one Contribution. Source Code: means all the Software’s instructions and program lines to which access is required so as to modify the Software. Object Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of the Source Code. Holder: means the holder of the economic copyright over the Initial Software. Licensee(s): mean(s) the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement. Contributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Contribution.

Module: means a set of sources files including their documentation that, once compiled in executable form, enables supplementary functionalities or services to be developed in addition to those offered by the Software. Dynamic Module: means any or all module, created by the Contributor, that is independent of the Software, so that this module and the Software are in two different executable forms that are run in separate address spaces, with one calling the other when they are run. Static Module: means any or all module, created by the Contributor and connected to the Software by a static link that makes their object codes interdependent. This module and the Software to which it is connected, are combined in a single executable. Parties: mean both the Licensee and the Licensor.

OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the distribution of said Initial Software. The Holder undertakes to maintain the distribution of the Initial Software under the conditions of the Agreement, for the duration set forth in article 4.2. #### 6.2. OVER THE CONTRIBUTIONS The intellectual property rights over the Contributions are attached to the holder of the economic rights as designated by effective legislation. #### 6.3. OVER THE DYNAMIC MODULES The Licensee having developed a Dynamic Module is the holder of the intellectual property rights over said Dynamic Module and is free to choose the agreement that shall govern its distribution. #### 6.4. JOINT PROVISIONS 6.4.1. The Licensee expressly undertakes: 1. not to remove, or modify, in any or all manner, the intellectual property notices affixed to the Software; 2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies of the Software. 6.4.2. The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any or all measures required to ensure respect for said intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors. ### Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES 7.1. Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software. However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of service. The terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such maintenance, shall then be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services shall incur liability therefor. 7.2. Similarly, any or all Licensor shall be entitled to offer to its Licensees, under its own responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified Software, under terms and conditions that it shall decide upon itself. Said warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application, shall be subject to a separate instrument executed between the Licensor and the Licensee. ### Article 8 - LIABILITY 8.1. Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor fail to fulfill all or part of its obligations hereunder, the Licensee shall be entitled to claim compensation for the direct loss suffered that it is able to justify, subject to providing proof of negligence by the Licensor in question. 8.2. The Licensor’s liability is limited to the commitments made under this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result , in particular: (i) of loss due the Licensee’s total or partial failure to fulfill its obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to the Software’s use or performance that is suffered by the Licensee, when the latter is a professional using said Software for professional purposes and (iii) consequential loss due to the Software’s use or performance. The Parties expressly agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data, loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders, opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party, shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to any or all compensation from the Licensor. ### Article 9 - WARRANTY 9.1. The Licensee acknowledges that the current situation as regards scientific and technical know-how at the time when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee’s attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software that are reserved for experienced users. The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the product’s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper functioning, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or property. 9.2. The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights on the Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article 5). 9.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied “as is” by the Licensor without any or all other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any or all warranty as to its market value, its securised, innovative or relevant nature. Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee’s own equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee’s requirements. 9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee’s use of the Software’s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark. ### Article 10 - TERMINATION 10.1. In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has remained ineffective. 10.2. The Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any or all licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof. ### Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS #### 11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as, notably, defective functioning, or interruptions affecting the electricity or telecommunications networks, blocking of the network following a virus attack, the intervention of the government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc. 11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently. 11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives. 11.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be null and void. #### 11.5. LANGUAGE The Agreement is drafted in both French and English. In the event of a conflict as regards construction, the French version shall be deemed authentic. ### Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT 12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement. 12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, that reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may incorporate new problems encountered by the free software. 12.3. Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of article 5.3.4. ### Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION 13.1. The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement out-of-court. 13.2. In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months as from their occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.

Definitionen a. Der Begriff '"Abwandlung'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff '"Sammelwerk'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. '"Verbreiten'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Der '"Lizenzgeber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. '"Rechteinhaber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. f. Der Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit '"Sie'" bzw. '"Ihnen'" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter '"Öffentlich Zeigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. i. '"Vervielfältigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.c) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ('"unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann'"): a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. c. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber für alle Fälle einer lizenzgerechten Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Weitergehende Änderungen oder Abwandlungen sind jedoch untersagt. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.b) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ('"Zuschreibungsempfänger'"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.b) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. c.

Definitionen a. Der Begriff '"Abwandlung'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff '"Sammelwerk'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. '"Verbreiten'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Unter '"Lizenzelementen'" werden im Sinne dieser Lizenz die folgenden übergeordneten Lizenzcharakteristika verstanden, die vom Lizenzgeber ausgewählt wurden und in der Bezeichnung der Lizenz zum Ausdruck kommen: '"Namensnennung'", '"Keine kommerzielle Nutzung'", '"Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen'". e. Der '"Lizenzgeber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. f. '"Rechteinhaber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. g. Der Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" bezeichnet in dieser Lizenz den literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalt, der unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz angeboten wird. Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. h. Mit '"Sie'" bzw. '"Ihnen'" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. i. Unter '"Öffentlich Zeigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. j. '"Vervielfältigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 4.f) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ('"unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann'"): a. Den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt; c. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten; d. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes zu veröffentlichen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4. Bedingungen. Die Einräumung des Nutzungsrechts gemäß Abschnitt 3 dieser Lizenz erfolgt ausdrücklich nur unter den folgenden Bedingungen: a. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie müssen dabei stets eine Kopie dieser Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz oder die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte beschränken. Sie dürfen den Schutzgegenstand nicht unterlizenzieren. Bei jeder Kopie des Schutzgegenstandes, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise unverändert lassen, die auf diese Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss hinweisen. Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.d) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.d) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b. Sie dürfen eine Abwandlung ausschließlich unter den Bedingungen i. dieser Lizenz, ii. einer späteren Version dieser Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen; iii. einer rechtsordnungsspezifischen Creative-Commons-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts (z.B. Namensnennung - Keine kommerzielle Nutzung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US) oder iv. der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen ('"Verwendbare Lizenz'"). Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Abwandlung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Abwandlung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Abwandlung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Abwandlung einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. c. Die Rechteeinräumung gemäß Abschnitt 3 gilt nur für Handlungen, die nicht vorrangig auf einen geschäftlichen Vorteil oder eine geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet sind ('"nicht-kommerzielle Nutzung'", '"Non-commercial-Option'"). Wird Ihnen in Zusammenhang mit dem Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz ein anderer Schutzgegenstand überlassen, ohne dass eine vertragliche Verpflichtung hierzu besteht (etwa im Wege von File-Sharing), so wird dies nicht als auf geschäftlichen Vorteil oder geldwerte Vergütung gerichtet angesehen, wenn in Verbindung mit dem Austausch der Schutzgegenstände tatsächlich keine Zahlung oder geldwerte Vergütung geleistet wird. d. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ('"Zuschreibungsempfänger'"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B. Internetadresse), den der Lizenzgeber zum Schutzgegenstand angegeben hat, es sei denn, dieser URI verweist nicht auf den Rechtevermerk oder die Lizenzinformationen zum Schutzgegenstand; iv. und im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes in Übereinstimmung mit Abschnitt 3.b) einen Hinweis darauf, dass es sich um eine Abwandlung handelt. Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.d) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. e. Die oben unter 4.a) bis d) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. f. Bezüglich Vergütung für die Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes gilt Folgendes: i. Unverzichtbare gesetzliche Vergütungsansprüche: Soweit unverzichtbare Vergütungsansprüche im Gegenzug für gesetzliche Lizenzen vorgesehen oder Pauschalabgabensysteme (zum Beispiel für Leermedien) vorhanden sind, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht vor, die entsprechende Vergütung einzuziehen für jede Ausübung eines Rechts aus dieser Lizenz durch Sie. ii. Vergütung bei Zwangslizenzen: Sofern Zwangslizenzen außerhalb dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind und zustande kommen, behält sich der Lizenzgeber das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.c) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen, verzichtet für alle übrigen, lizenzgerechten Fälle von Nutzung jedoch auf jegliche Vergütung. iii. Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Der Lizenzgeber behält sich jedoch das ausschließliche Recht auf Einziehung der entsprechenden Vergütung (durch ihn selbst oder eine Verwertungsgesellschaft) für den Fall vor, dass Sie eine Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes für andere als die in Abschnitt 4.c) als nicht-kommerziell definierten Zwecke vornehmen. g. Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART. DIES UMFASST INSBESONDERE DAS FREISEIN VON SACH- UND RECHTSMÄNGELN, UNABHÄNGIG VON DEREN ERKENNBARKEIT FÜR DEN LIZENZGEBER, DIE VERKEHRSFÄHIGKEIT DES SCHUTZGEGENSTANDES, SEINE VERWENDBARKEIT FÜR EINEN BESTIMMTEN ZWECK SOWIE DIE KORREKTHEIT VON BESCHREIBUNGEN. DIESE GEWÄHRLEISTUNGSBESCHRÄNKUNG GILT NICHT, SOWEIT MÄNGEL ZU SCHÄDEN DER IN ABSCHNITT 6 BEZEICHNETEN ART FÜHREN UND AUF SEITEN DES LIZENZGEBERS DAS JEWEILS GENANNTE VERSCHULDEN BZW. VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT. 6. Haftungsbeschränkung DER LIZENZGEBER HAFTET IHNEN GEGENÜBER IN BEZUG AUF SCHÄDEN AUS DER VERLETZUNG DES LEBENS, DES KÖRPERS ODER DER GESUNDHEIT NUR, SOFERN IHM WENIGSTENS FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT VORZUWERFEN IST, FÜR SONSTIGE SCHÄDEN NUR BEI GROBER FAHRLÄSSIGKEIT ODER VORSATZ, UND ÜBERNIMMT DARÜBER HINAUS KEINERLEI FREIWILLIGE HAFTUNG. 7. Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten.

Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz unwirksam sein, so bleibt davon die Wirksamkeit der Lizenz im Übrigen unberührt. d. Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar.

Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. h. Mit '"Sie'" bzw.

Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3.

Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt.

Wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer des Schutzgegenstandes in der Ausübung der ihm durch diese Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.a) gilt auch für den Fall, dass der Schutzgegenstand einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt dieser Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. Sofern Sie ein Sammelwerk erstellen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin aus dem Sammelwerk die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. Wenn Sie eine Abwandlung vornehmen, müssen Sie auf die Mitteilung eines Lizenzgebers hin von der Abwandlung die in Abschnitt 4.c) aufgezählten Hinweise entfernen. b.

Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 US), iv. der Creative-Commons-Unported-Lizenz mit denselben Lizenzelementen ab Version 3.0 aufwärts, oder v. einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Falls Sie die Abwandlung gemäß Abschnitt (v) unter einer mit Creative Commons kompatiblen Lizenz lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen Folge leisten. Falls Sie die Abwandlungen unter einer der unter (i)-(iv) genannten Lizenzen ('"Verwendbare Lizenzen'") lizenzieren, müssen Sie deren Lizenzbestimmungen sowie folgenden Bestimmungen Folge leisten: Sie müssen stets eine Kopie der verwendbaren Lizenz oder deren vollständige Internetadresse in Form des Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI) beifügen, wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen. Sie dürfen keine Vertrags- oder Nutzungsbedingungen anbieten oder fordern, die die Bedingungen der verwendbaren Lizenz oder die durch sie gewährten Rechte beschränken. Bei jeder Abwandlung, die Sie verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, müssen Sie alle Hinweise auf die verwendbare Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Wenn Sie die Abwandlung verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, dürfen Sie (in Bezug auf die Abwandlung) keine technischen Maßnahmen ergreifen, die den Nutzer der Abwandlung in der Ausübung der ihm durch die verwendbare Lizenz gewährten Rechte behindern können. Dieser Abschnitt 4.b) gilt auch für den Fall, dass die Abwandlung einen Bestandteil eines Sammelwerkes bildet, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass das Sammelwerk insgesamt der verwendbaren Lizenz unterstellt werden muss. c. Die Verbreitung und das öffentliche Zeigen des Schutzgegenstandes oder auf ihm aufbauender Abwandlungen oder ihn enthaltender Sammelwerke ist Ihnen nur unter der Bedingung gestattet, dass Sie, vorbehaltlich etwaiger Mitteilungen im Sinne von Abschnitt 4.a), alle dazu gehörenden Rechtevermerke unberührt lassen. Sie sind verpflichtet, die Rechteinhaberschaft in einer der Nutzung entsprechenden, angemessenen Form anzuerkennen, indem Sie - soweit bekannt - Folgendes angeben: i. Den Namen (oder das Pseudonym, falls ein solches verwendet wird) des Rechteinhabers und / oder, falls der Lizenzgeber im Rechtevermerk, in den Nutzungsbedingungen oder auf andere angemessene Weise eine Zuschreibung an Dritte vorgenommen hat (z.B. an eine Stiftung, ein Verlagshaus oder eine Zeitung) ('"Zuschreibungsempfänger'"), Namen bzw. Bezeichnung dieses oder dieser Dritten; ii. den Titel des Inhaltes; iii. in einer praktikablen Form den Uniform-Resource-Identifier (URI, z.B.

Die nach diesem Abschnitt 4.c) erforderlichen Angaben können in jeder angemessenen Form gemacht werden; im Falle einer Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes oder eines Sammelwerkes müssen diese Angaben das Minimum darstellen und bei gemeinsamer Nennung mehrerer Rechteinhaber dergestalt erfolgen, dass sie zumindest ebenso hervorgehoben sind wie die Hinweise auf die übrigen Rechteinhaber. Die Angaben nach diesem Abschnitt dürfen Sie ausschließlich zur Angabe der Rechteinhaberschaft in der oben bezeichneten Weise verwenden. Durch die Ausübung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz dürfen Sie ohne eine vorherige, separat und schriftlich vorliegende Zustimmung des Lizenzgebers und / oder des Zuschreibungsempfängers weder explizit noch implizit irgendeine Verbindung zum Lizenzgeber oder Zuschreibungsempfänger und ebenso wenig eine Unterstützung oder Billigung durch ihn andeuten. d. Die oben unter 4.a) bis c) genannten Einschränkungen gelten nicht für solche Teile des Schutzgegenstandes, die allein deshalb unter den Schutzgegenstandsbegriff fallen, weil sie als Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen. e. Persönlichkeitsrechte bleiben - soweit sie bestehen - von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 5. Gewährleistung SOFERN KEINE ANDERS LAUTENDE, SCHRIFTLICHE VEREINBARUNG ZWISCHEN DEM LIZENZGEBER UND IHNEN GESCHLOSSEN WURDE UND SOWEIT MÄNGEL NICHT ARGLISTIG VERSCHWIEGEN WURDEN, BIETET DER LIZENZGEBER DEN SCHUTZGEGENSTAND UND DIE EINRÄUMUNG VON RECHTEN UNTER AUSSCHLUSS JEGLICHER GEWÄHRLEISTUNG AN UND ÜBERNIMMT WEDER AUSDRÜCKLICH NOCH KONKLUDENT GARANTIEN IRGENDEINER ART.

VERTRETENMÜSSEN EBENFALLS VORLIEGT. 6.

Erlöschen a. Diese Lizenz und die durch sie eingeräumten Nutzungsrechte erlöschen mit Wirkung für die Zukunft im Falle eines Verstoßes gegen die Lizenzbedingungen durch Sie, ohne dass es dazu der Kenntnis des Lizenzgebers vom Verstoß oder einer weiteren Handlung einer der Vertragsparteien bedarf. Mit natürlichen oder juristischen Personen, die Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes oder diesen enthaltende Sammelwerke unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz von Ihnen erhalten haben, bestehen nachträglich entstandene Lizenzbeziehungen jedoch solange weiter, wie die genannten Personen sich ihrerseits an sämtliche Lizenzbedingungen halten. Darüber hinaus gelten die Ziffern 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, und 8 auch nach einem Erlöschen dieser Lizenz fort. b. Vorbehaltlich der oben genannten Bedingungen gilt diese Lizenz unbefristet bis der rechtliche Schutz für den Schutzgegenstand ausläuft. Davon abgesehen behält der Lizenzgeber das Recht, den Schutzgegenstand unter anderen Lizenzbedingungen anzubieten oder die eigene Weitergabe des Schutzgegenstandes jederzeit einzustellen, solange die Ausübung dieses Rechts nicht einer Kündigung oder einem Widerruf dieser Lizenz (oder irgendeiner Weiterlizenzierung, die auf Grundlage dieser Lizenz bereits erfolgt ist bzw. zukünftig noch erfolgen muss) dient und diese Lizenz unter Berücksichtigung der oben zum Erlöschen genannten Bedingungen vollumfänglich wirksam bleibt. 8. Sonstige Bestimmungen a. Jedes Mal wenn Sie den Schutzgegenstand für sich genommen oder als Teil eines Sammelwerkes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. b. Jedes Mal wenn Sie eine Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes verbreiten oder öffentlich zeigen, bietet der Lizenzgeber dem Empfänger eine Lizenz am ursprünglichen Schutzgegenstand zu den gleichen Bedingungen und im gleichen Umfang an, wie Ihnen in Form dieser Lizenz. c.

Keine Bestimmung dieser Lizenz soll als abbedungen und kein Verstoß gegen sie als zulässig gelten, solange die von dem Verzicht oder von dem Verstoß betroffene Seite nicht schriftlich zugestimmt hat. e. Diese Lizenz (zusammen mit in ihr ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Erlaubnissen, Mitteilungen und Zustimmungen, soweit diese tatsächlich vorliegen) stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand dar. Es bestehen keine Abreden, Vereinbarungen oder Erklärungen in Bezug auf den Schutzgegenstand, die in dieser Lizenz nicht genannt sind.

La distribution de la présente version de ce contrat ne crée aucune relation juridique entre les parties au contrat présenté ci-après et Creative Commons. Creative Commons fournit cette offre de contrat-type en l''état, à seule fin d''information. Creative Commons ne saurait être tenu responsable des éventuels préjudices résultant du contenu ou de l''utilisation de ce contrat. Contrat L''Oeuvre (telle que définie ci-dessous) est mise à disposition selon les termes du présent contrat appelé Contrat Public Creative Commons (dénommé ici « CPCC » ou « Contrat »). L''Oeuvre est protégée par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droit d''auteur, droits voisins, droits des producteurs de bases de données) ou toute autre loi applicable. Toute utilisation de l''Oeuvre autrement qu''explicitement autorisée selon ce Contrat ou le droit applicable est interdite. L''exercice sur l''Oeuvre de tout droit proposé par le présent contrat vaut acceptation de celui-ci. Selon les termes et les obligations du présent contrat, la partie Offrante propose à la partie Acceptante l''exercice de certains droits présentés ci-après, et l''Acceptant en approuve les termes et conditions d''utilisation. 1. Définitions a. « Oeuvre » : oeuvre de l''esprit protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou toute loi applicable et qui est mise à disposition selon les termes du présent Contrat. b. « Oeuvre dite Collective » : une oeuvre dans laquelle l''oeuvre, dans sa forme intégrale et non modifiée, est assemblée en un ensemble collectif avec d''autres contributions qui constituent en elles-mêmes des oeuvres séparées et indépendantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres dites Collectives les publications périodiques, les anthologies ou les encyclopédies. Aux termes de la présente autorisation, une oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre dite Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée (telle que définie ci-après). c. « Oeuvre dite Dérivée » : une oeuvre créée soit à partir de l''Oeuvre seule, soit à partir de l''Oeuvre et d''autres oeuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Oeuvres dites Dérivées les traductions, les arrangements musicaux, les adaptations théâtrales, littéraires ou cinématographiques, les enregistrements sonores, les reproductions par un art ou un procédé quelconque, les résumés, ou toute autre forme sous laquelle l''Oeuvre puisse être remaniée, modifiée, transformée ou adaptée, à l''exception d''une oeuvre qui constitue une Oeuvre dite Collective. Une Oeuvre dite Collective ne sera pas considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée aux termes du présent Contrat. Dans le cas où l''Oeuvre serait une composition musicale ou un enregistrement sonore, la synchronisation de l''oeuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Oeuvre dite Dérivée pour les propos de ce Contrat. d. « Auteur original » : la ou les personnes physiques qui ont créé l''Oeuvre. e. « Offrant » : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) qui proposent la mise à disposition de l''Oeuvre selon les termes du présent Contrat. f. « Acceptant » : la personne physique ou morale qui accepte le présent contrat et exerce des droits sans en avoir violé les termes au préalable ou qui a reçu l''autorisation expresse de l''Offrant d''exercer des droits dans le cadre du présent contrat malgré une précédente violation de ce contrat. g. « Options du Contrat » : les attributs génériques du Contrat tels qu''ils ont été choisis par l''Offrant et indiqués dans le titre de ce Contrat : Paternité - Pas d''Utilisation Commerciale - Partage Des Conditions Initiales A l''Identique. 2. Exceptions aux droits exclusifs. Aucune disposition de ce contrat n''a pour intention de réduire, limiter ou restreindre les prérogatives issues des exceptions aux droits, de l''épuisement des droits ou d''autres limitations aux droits exclusifs des ayants droit selon le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou les autres lois applicables. 3. Autorisation. Soumis aux termes et conditions définis dans cette autorisation, et ceci pendant toute la durée de protection de l''Oeuvre par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique ou le droit applicable, l''Offrant accorde à l''Acceptant l''autorisation mondiale d''exercer à titre gratuit et non exclusif les droits suivants : a. reproduire l''Oeuvre, incorporer l''Oeuvre dans une ou plusieurs Oeuvres dites Collectives et reproduire l''Oeuvre telle qu''incorporée dans lesdites Oeuvres dites Collectives; b. créer et reproduire des Oeuvres dites Dérivées; c. distribuer des exemplaires ou enregistrements, présenter, représenter ou communiquer l''Oeuvre au public par tout procédé technique, y compris incorporée dans des Oeuvres Collectives; d. distribuer des exemplaires ou phonogrammes, présenter, représenter ou communiquer au public des Oeuvres dites Dérivées par tout procédé technique; e. lorsque l''Oeuvre est une base de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles de l''Oeuvre. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous les supports, médias, procédés techniques et formats. Les droits ci-dessus incluent le droit d''effectuer les modifications nécessaires techniquement à l''exercice des droits dans d''autres formats et procédés techniques. L''exercice de tous les droits qui ne sont pas expressément autorisés par l''Offrant ou dont il n''aurait pas la gestion demeure réservé, notamment les mécanismes de gestion collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l''article 4(e). 4. Restrictions. L''autorisation accordée par l''article 3 est expressément assujettie et limitée par le respect des restrictions suivantes : a. L''Acceptant peut reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public l''Oeuvre y compris par voie numérique uniquement selon les termes de ce Contrat. L''Acceptant doit inclure une copie ou l''adresse Internet (Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource) du présent Contrat à toute reproduction ou enregistrement de l''Oeuvre que l''Acceptant distribue, représente ou communique au public y compris par voie numérique. L''Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d''utilisation de l''Oeuvre qui altèrent ou restreignent les termes du présent Contrat ou l''exercice des droits qui y sont accordés au bénéficiaire. L''Acceptant ne peut pas céder de droits sur l''Oeuvre. L''Acceptant doit conserver intactes toutes les informations qui renvoient à ce Contrat et à l''exonération de responsabilité. L''Acceptant ne peut pas reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public l''Oeuvre, y compris par voie numérique, en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d''accès ou de contrôle d''utilisation qui serait contradictoire avec les termes de cet Accord contractuel. Les mentions ci-dessus s''appliquent à l''Oeuvre telle qu''incorporée dans une Oeuvre dite Collective, mais, en dehors de l''Oeuvre en elle-même, ne soumettent pas l''Oeuvre dite Collective, aux termes du présent Contrat. Si l''Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Collective, à la demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l''Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence au dit Offrant, comme demandé. Si l''Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Collective, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l''Oeuvre dite Collective toute référence au dit Auteur, comme demandé. Si l''Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, à la demande de tout Offrant, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit Offrant, comme demandé. Si l''Acceptant crée une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, à la demande de tout Auteur, il devra, dans la mesure du possible, retirer de l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée toute référence au dit Auteur, comme demandé. b. L''Acceptant peut reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public une Oeuvre dite Dérivée y compris par voie numérique uniquement sous les termes de ce Contrat, ou d''une version ultérieure de ce Contrat comprenant les mêmes Options du Contrat que le présent Contrat, ou un Contrat Creative Commons iCommons comprenant les mêmes Options du Contrat que le présent Contrat (par exemple Paternité - Pas d''Utilisation Commerciale - Partage Des Conditions Initiales A l''Identique 2.0 Japon). L''Acceptant doit inclure une copie ou l''adresse Internet (Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource) du présent Contrat, ou d''un autre Contrat tel que décrit à la phrase précédente, à toute reproduction ou enregistrement de l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée que l''Acceptant distribue, représente ou communique au public y compris par voie numérique. L''Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d''utilisation sur l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée qui altèrent ou restreignent les termes du présent Contrat ou l''exercice des droits qui y sont accordés au bénéficiaire, et doit conserver intactes toutes les informations qui renvoient à ce Contrat et à l''avertissement sur les garanties. L''Acceptant ne peut pas reproduire, distribuer, représenter ou communiquer au public y compris par voie numérique l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée en utilisant une mesure technique de contrôle d''accès ou de contrôle d''utilisation qui serait contradictoire avec les termes de cet Accord contractuel. Les mentions ci-dessus s''appliquent à l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée telle qu''incorporée dans une Oeuvre dite Collective, mais, en dehors de l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée en elle-même, ne soumettent pas l''Oeuvre Collective, aux termes du présent Contrat. c. L''Acceptant ne peut exercer aucun des droits conférés par l''article 3 avec l''intention ou l''objectif d''obtenir un profit commercial ou une compensation financière personnelle. L''échange de l''Oeuvre avec d''autres Oeuvres protégées par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique par le partage électronique de fichiers, ou par tout autre moyen, n''est pas considéré comme un échange avec l''intention ou l''objectif d''un profit commercial ou d''une compensation financière personnelle, dans la mesure où aucun paiement ou compensation financière n''intervient en relation avec l''échange d''Oeuvres protégées. d. Si l''Acceptant reproduit, distribue, représente ou communique au public, y compris par voie numérique, l''Oeuvre ou toute Oeuvre dite Dérivée ou toute Oeuvre dite Collective, il doit conserver intactes toutes les informations sur le régime des droits et en attribuer la paternité à l''Auteur Original, de manière raisonnable au regard au médium ou au moyen utilisé. Il doit communiquer le nom de l''Auteur Original ou son éventuel pseudonyme s''il est indiqué ; le titre de l''Oeuvre Originale s''il est indiqué ; dans la mesure du possible, l''adresse Internet ou Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), s''il existe, spécifié par l''Offrant comme associé à l''Oeuvre, à moins que cette adresse ne renvoie pas aux informations légales (paternité et conditions d''utilisation de l''Oeuvre). Dans le cas d''une Oeuvre dite Dérivée, il doit indiquer les éléments identifiant l''utilisation l''Oeuvre dans l''Oeuvre dite Dérivée par exemple « Traduction anglaise de l''Oeuvre par l''Auteur Original » ou « Scénario basé sur l''Oeuvre par l''Auteur Original ». Ces obligations d''attribution de paternité doivent être exécutées de manière raisonnable. Cependant, dans le cas d''une Oeuvre dite Dérivée ou d''une Oeuvre dite Collective, ces informations doivent, au minimum, apparaître à la place et de manière aussi visible que celles à laquelle apparaissent les informations de même nature. e. Dans le cas où une utilisation de l''Oeuvre serait soumise à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire, l''Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l''intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d''Oeuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie. 5. Garantie et exonération de responsabilité a. En mettant l''Oeuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de ce Contrat, l''Offrant déclare de bonne foi qu''à sa connaissance et dans les limites d''une enquête raisonnable : i. L''Offrant a obtenu tous les droits sur l''Oeuvre nécessaires pour pouvoir autoriser l''exercice des droits accordés par le présent Contrat, et permettre la jouissance paisible et l''exercice licite de ces droits, ceci sans que l''Acceptant n''ait aucune obligation de verser de rémunération ou tout autre paiement ou droits, dans la limite des mécanismes de gestion collective obligatoire applicables décrits à l''article 4(e); ii. L''Oeuvre n''est constitutive ni d''une violation des droits de tiers, notamment du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique, du droit des marques, du droit de l''information, du droit civil ou de tout autre droit, ni de diffamation, de violation de la vie privée ou de tout autre préjudice délictuel à l''égard de toute tierce partie. b. A l''exception des situations expressément mentionnées dans le présent Contrat ou dans un autre accord écrit, ou exigées par la loi applicable, l''Oeuvre est mise à disposition en l''état sans garantie d''aucune sorte, qu''elle soit expresse ou tacite, y compris à l''égard du contenu ou de l''exactitude de l''Oeuvre. 6. Limitation de responsabilité.

Résiliation a. Tout manquement aux termes du contrat par l''Acceptant entraîne la résiliation automatique du Contrat et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Cependant, le contrat conserve ses effets envers les personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l''Acceptant, en exécution du présent contrat, la mise à disposition d''Oeuvres dites Dérivées, ou d''Oeuvres dites Collectives, ceci tant qu''elles respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les sections 1, 2, 5, 6 et 7 du contrat continuent à s''appliquer après la résiliation de celui-ci. b. Dans les limites indiquées ci-dessus, le présent Contrat s''applique pendant toute la durée de protection de l''Oeuvre selon le droit applicable. Néanmoins, l''Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d''exploiter l''Oeuvre sous des conditions contractuelles différentes, ou d''en cesser la diffusion; cependant, le recours à cette option ne doit pas conduire à retirer les effets du présent Contrat (ou de tout contrat qui a été ou doit être accordé selon les termes de ce Contrat), et ce Contrat continuera à s''appliquer dans tous ses effets jusqu''à ce que sa résiliation intervienne dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus. 8. Divers a. A chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie numérique de l''Oeuvre ou d''une Oeuvre dite Collective par l''Acceptant, l''Offrant propose au bénéficiaire une offre de mise à disposition de l''Oeuvre dans des termes et conditions identiques à ceux accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat. b. A chaque reproduction ou communication au public par voie numérique d''une Oeuvre dite Dérivée par l''Acceptant, l''Offrant propose au bénéficiaire une offre de mise à disposition du bénéficiaire de l''Oeuvre originale dans des termes et conditions identiques à ceux accordés à la partie Acceptante dans le présent Contrat. c. La nullité ou l''inapplicabilité d''une quelconque disposition de ce Contrat au regard de la loi applicable n''affecte pas celle des autres dispositions qui resteront pleinement valides et applicables. Sans action additionnelle par les parties à cet accord, lesdites dispositions devront être interprétées dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à leur validité et leur applicabilité. d. Aucune limite, renonciation ou modification des termes ou dispositions du présent Contrat ne pourra être acceptée sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie compétente. e. Ce Contrat constitue le seul accord entre les parties à propos de l''Oeuvre mise ici à disposition. Il n''existe aucun élément annexe, accord supplémentaire ou mandat portant sur cette Oeuvre en dehors des éléments mentionnés ici. L''Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une quelconque communication en provenance de l''Acceptant. Ce Contrat ne peut être modifié sans l''accord mutuel écrit de l''Offrant et de l''Acceptant. f. Le droit applicable est le droit français. Creative Commons n''est pas partie à ce Contrat et n''offre aucune forme de garantie relative à l''Oeuvre. Creative Commons décline toute responsabilité à l''égard de l''Acceptant ou de toute autre partie, quel que soit le fondement légal de cette responsabilité et quel que soit le préjudice subi, direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, qui surviendrait en rapport avec le présent Contrat. Cependant, si Creative Commons s''est expressément identifié comme Offrant pour mettre une Oeuvre à disposition selon les termes de ce Contrat, Creative Commons jouira de tous les droits et obligations d''un Offrant.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. **Section 1 – Definitions.** 1. **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. 2. **Adapter''s License** means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. 3. **BY-SA Compatible License** means a license listed at [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License. 4. **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section [2(b)(1)-(2)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2b) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. 5. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. 6. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. 7. **License Elements** means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike. 8. **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. 9. **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. 10. **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. 11. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. 12. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 13. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. **Your** has a corresponding meaning. **Section 2 – Scope.** 1. **License grant**. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and 2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section [2(a)(4)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. 1. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. 2. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply. 3. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai). 2. **Other rights**. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. **Section 3 – License Conditions.** Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. 1. **Attribution**. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: 1. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: 1. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); 2. a copyright notice; 3. a notice that refers to this Public License; 4. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; 5. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; 2. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and 3. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section [3(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section [3(a)(1)(A)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 2. **ShareAlike**. In addition to the conditions in Section [3(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. 1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License. 2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter''s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter''s License You apply. **Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.** Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: 1. for the avoidance of doubt, Section [2(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s2a1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; 2. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section [3(b)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3b); and 3. You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s3a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s4) supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. **Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.** 1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.** 2. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.** 1. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. **Section 6 – Term and Termination.** 1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. 2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. 3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. 4. Sections [1](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s1), [5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s5), [6](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s6), [7](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s7), and [8](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode#s8) survive termination of this Public License. **Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.** 1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. 2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. **Section 8 – Interpretation.** 1. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. 2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. 3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. 4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at [creativecommons.org/policies](http://creativecommons.org/policies), Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'''') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 3\.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'''' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5\. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 6\. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public License, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License, Version 1.0. 7\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

LEGAL ISSUES

In plain English:

1. We don''t promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don''t have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you''ve used the IJG code.
In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided '"AS IS'", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that '"this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group'".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author''s name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as '"the Independent JPEG Group''s software'".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script '"configure'" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce '"uncompressed GIFs'". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
'"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

License Grants; No Trademark License Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You: a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work. b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Covered Works. This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service marks, or logos. 2. Distribution: General Conditions You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain pertinent). '"Legal Notices'" means copyright notices, license notices, license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos, other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends. 3. Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work. If the Derived Work includes material licensed under the GPL, You may instead license the Derived Work under the GPL. 4. Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under this License. This condition is not excused merely because such restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a third party). However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of this License, provided that compliance with such other license would not conflict with any conditions stated in other sections of this License. 5. Conditions for Distributing Object Code You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary means of providing network access to source code. If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible storage medium ('"Product'"), the Corresponding Source must be available through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply with the first paragraph of this section. Each direct and indirect recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right to enforce its terms. 6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or modification of a Covered Work (a '"Patch'"), and no explicit licensing terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch. 7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to the conditions in sections 3 through 5. 8. Copyleft Sunset The conditions in sections 3 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work under this License. 9. Pass-Through When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License. 10. Termination Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims) alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent. Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to this License. To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary merely for running it, such permission is not terminable. 11. Later License Versions The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next, designated by a distinguishing version number ('"Later Versions'"). Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version. ** 12. No Warranty ** ** ** ** My Work is provided '"as-is'", without warranty. You bear the risk ** ** of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each ** ** Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title, ** ** merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and ** ** non-infringement. ** ** 13. Limitation of Liability ** ** ** ** To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any ** ** Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages ** ** whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or ** ** consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort ** ** (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor ** ** knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages. ** 14. Severability The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 15. Definitions '"Copyleft-Next Project'" means the project that maintains the source code repository at <https://github.com/copyleft-next/copyleft-next.git/> as of the release date of this License. '"Corresponding Source'" of a Covered Work in Object Code form means (i) the Source Code form of the Covered Work; (ii) all scripts, instructions and similar information that are reasonably necessary for a skilled developer to generate such Object Code from the Source Code provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly identifying all Separate Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii)) that were specifically used in building and (if applicable) installing the Covered Work (for example, a specified proprietary compiler including its version number). Corresponding Source must be machine-readable. '"Covered Work'" means My Work or a Derived Work. '"Derived Work'" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies, adapts, is based on, is a derivative work of, transforms, translates or contains all or part of My Work, such that copyright permission is required. The following are not Derived Works: (i) Mere Aggregation; (ii) a mere reproduction of My Work; and (iii) if My Work fails to explicitly state an expectation otherwise, a work that merely makes reference to My Work. '"Distribute'" means to distribute, transfer or make a copy available to someone else, such that copyright permission is required. '"Distributor'" means Me and anyone else who Distributes a Covered Work. '"FSF-Free'" means classified as ''free'' by the Free Software Foundation. '"GPL'" means a version of the GNU General Public License or the GNU Affero General Public License. '"I'"/'"Me'"/'"My'" refers to the individual or legal entity that places My Work under this License. '"You'"/'"Your'" refers to the individual or legal entity exercising rights in My Work under this License. A legal entity includes each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such legal entity. '"Control'" means (a) the power to direct the actions of such legal entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such legal entity. '"Licensed Patents'" means all patent claims licensable royalty-free by Me, now or in the future, that are necessarily infringed by making, using, or selling My Work, and excludes claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of My Work. '"Mere Aggregation'" means an aggregation of a Covered Work with a Separate Work. '"My Work'" means the particular work of authorship I license to You under this License. '"Object Code'" means any form of a work that is not Source Code. '"OSI-Approved'" means approved as ''Open Source'' by the Open Source Initiative. '"Separate Work'" means a work that is separate from and independent of a particular Covered Work and is not by its nature an extension or enhancement of the Covered Work, and/or a runtime library, standard library or similar component that is used to generate an Object Code form of a Covered Work. '"Source Code'" means the preferred form of a work for making modifications to it"

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers'' and authors'' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users'' and authors'' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations. To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work. A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1\. Source Code. The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work. A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work''s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2\. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3\. Protecting Users'' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work''s users, your or third parties'' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7\. Additional Terms. “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8\. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer- to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party''s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11\. Patents. A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor''s “contributor version”. A contributor''s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor''s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient''s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non- exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12\. No Surrender of Others'' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14\. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy''s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15\. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16\. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. Copyright (C) This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see . Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: \r\nCopyright (C) This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w''. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w'' and `show c'' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program''s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read . "

Preamble The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation''s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author''s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'' reputations. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0\. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The '"Program'", below, refers to any such program or work, and a '"work based on the Program'" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". 1\. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy. 2\. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following: a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option). c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License. d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms. 3\. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine- readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.) Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system. 4\. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5\. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions. 6\. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. 7\. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and '"any later version'", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 8\. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 9\. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 10\. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the '"copyright'" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. Copyright (C) 19yy This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w''. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w'' and `show c'' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w'' and `show c''; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a '"copyright disclaimer'" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision'' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker. , 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice That''s all there is to it!

If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. > >> (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant’s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. > 8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging > that such Participant’s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes > any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) > prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the > reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections > 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of > any payment or license. > 8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end > user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have > been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to > termination shall survive termination. 9\.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR > DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE > EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT > ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO > THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10\. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. > The Covered Code is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 > C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” and > “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 > C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. > 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users > acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11\. MISCELLANEOUS. > This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter > hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such > provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it > enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions > (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding > its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least > one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do > business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this > License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the > Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, > California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without > limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The > application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the > International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation > which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against > the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12\. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. > As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each > party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, > out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work > with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute > such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or > shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13\. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. > Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple- > Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to > utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the > alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file > described in Exhibit A. 14\. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION > (a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the > Original Code (“Original Developer”), in the hope that its promotional value > may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original > Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (“Attribution > Information”) a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or > a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a > session), a prominent display of the Original Developer’s Attribution > Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface > employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include > display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be > consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution > Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code > does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, > this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such > Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a > splash screen, notice at login, an “about” display, or dedicated attribution > area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that > Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice. > (b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief > phrase, graphic image and a URL (“Attribution Information”) and is subject > to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent > shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the > user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include > Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must > ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be > no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information > for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may > choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement > only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original > Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide > for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot > require that You display, at any time, more than the following information > as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the > Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) > one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and (d) a URL > (collectively, the “Attribution Limits”). > (c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there > are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the > Original Developer. > (d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names > contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered > Code are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with > the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted > by law or as expressly set out in this License. 15\. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE. > The term “External Deployment” means the use, distribution, or communication > of the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code > or Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works > are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an > application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the > grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You > of the Original Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 > and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

PREAMBLE This license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application program interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software, any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work. This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 2. DEFINITIONS 2.1 This License applies to any program (or other '"work'") which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License. 2.2 The term '"Program'" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX''s GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work. 2.3 '"Derivative Work'" means, for the purpose of the License, that portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other portions of a work. 2.4 '"Modifications of the Program'" means any work, which includes a Derivative Work, and includes the whole of such work. 2.5 '"License'" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License. 2.6 The '"Source Code'" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable work. 2.7 '"3dfx'" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc. 3. LICENSED ACTIVITIES 3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program''s Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the provision of section 3.3 and provided also that: (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section 5; (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and (c) do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx, and (d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this License. 3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3 and provided that you also meet all of the following conditions: (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy of a Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section 5; (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and (c) give all recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this License along with the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this License. (d) You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. (e) You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or publish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. (f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx. (g) If the Derivative Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows: '"COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED '"AS IS,'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM INFO@3DFX.COM).'" (h) The requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the modified work as a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not the intent of this License to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of Derivative Works. 3.3 DISTRIBUTION (a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are distributed must include in the file headers the following language verbatim: '"THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED ONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR OR BY CONTACTING 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC (info@3dfx.com). THIS PROGRAM. IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS. USE, DUPLICATION OR DISCLOSURE BY THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION (C)(1)(II) OF THE RIGHTS IN TECHNICAL DATA AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE CLAUSE AT DFARS 252.227-7013, AND/OR IN SIMILAR OR SUCCESSOR CLAUSES IN THE FAR, DOD OR NASA FAR SUPPLEMENT. UNPUBLISHED RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED'" (b) You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided that you also do one of the following: (1) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or, (2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, (3) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.) (c) The source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable code. (d) If distribution of executable code or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. (e) Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and successor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and Derivative Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. (f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx. (g) You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program or any Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 4. MISCELLANEOUS 4.1 Acceptance of this License is voluntary. By using, modifying or distributing the Program or any Derivative Work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this License is in violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws. 4.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 4.3 This License is to be construed according to the laws of the State of California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the State of California in the event it is necessary to enforce the provisions of this License. 5. NO WARRANTIES 5.1 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS'"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 5.2 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC., OR ANY OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

Préambule Cette licence s''applique à tout logiciel distribué dont le titulaire du droit d''auteur précise qu''il est sujet aux termes de la Licence Libre du Québec – Réciprocité forte (LiLiQ-R+) (ci-après appelée la « licence »). 2. Définitions Dans la présente licence, à moins que le contexte n''indique un sens différent, on entend par: « concédant » : le titulaire du droit d''auteur sur le logiciel, ou toute personne dûment autorisée par ce dernier à accorder la présente licence; « contributeur » : le titulaire du droit d''auteur ou toute personne autorisée par ce dernier à soumettre au concédant une contribution. Un contributeur dont sa contribution est incorporée au logiciel est considéré comme un concédant en regard de sa contribution; « contribution » : tout logiciel original, ou partie de logiciel original soumis et destiné à être incorporé dans le logiciel; « distribution » : le fait de délivrer une copie du logiciel; « licencié » : toute personne qui possède une copie du logiciel et qui exerce les droits concédés par la licence; « logiciel » : une œuvre protégée par le droit d''auteur, telle qu''un programme d''ordinateur et sa documentation, pour laquelle le titulaire du droit d''auteur a précisé qu''elle est sujette aux termes de la présente licence; « logiciel dérivé » : tout logiciel original réalisé par un licencié, autre que le logiciel ou un logiciel modifié, qui produit ou reproduit la totalité ou une partie importante du logiciel; « logiciel modifié » : toute modification par un licencié de l''un des fichiers source du logiciel ou encore tout nouveau fichier source qui incorpore le logiciel ou une partie importante de ce dernier. 3. Licence de droit d''auteur Sous réserve des termes de la licence, le concédant accorde au licencié une licence non exclusive et libre de redevances lui permettant d’exercer les droits suivants sur le logiciel : 1 Produire ou reproduire la totalité ou une partie importante; 2 Exécuter ou représenter la totalité ou une partie importante en public; 3 Publier la totalité ou une partie importante. Cette licence est accordée sans limite territoriale et sans limite de temps. L''exercice complet de ces droits est sujet à la distribution par le concédant du code source du logiciel, lequel doit être sous une forme permettant d''y apporter des modifications. Le concédant peut aussi distribuer le logiciel accompagné d''une offre de distribuer le code source du logiciel, sans frais supplémentaires, autres que ceux raisonnables afin de permettre la livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide pendant une durée raisonnable. 4. Distribution Le licencié peut distribuer des copies du logiciel, d''un logiciel modifié ou dérivé, sous réserve de respecter les conditions suivantes : 1 Le logiciel doit être accompagné d''un exemplaire de cette licence; 2 Si le logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet une telle mention; 3 Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état des droits d''auteur, des marques de commerce, des garanties ou de la paternité concernant le logiciel ne doivent pas être modifiées ou supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes ou mentions ne soient inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé donné. 4.1. Réciprocité Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le concédant offre au récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel selon les termes de la présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une concession selon les termes de la présente licence pour tout logiciel modifié ou dérivé qu''il distribue. Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, un logiciel modifié, ou un logiciel dérivé, ce dernier doit assumer l''obligation d''en distribuer le code source, de la manière prévue au troisième alinéa de l''article 3. 4.2. Compatibilité Dans la mesure où le licencié souhaite distribuer un logiciel modifié ou dérivé combiné à un logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible, mais dont il ne serait pas possible d''en respecter les termes, le concédant offre, en plus de la présente concession, une concession selon les termes de cette licence compatible. Un licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit d''auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut pas se prévaloir de cette offre. Il en est de même pour toute autre personne dûment autorisée à sous-licencier par le titulaire exclusif du droit d''auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible. Est considérée comme une licence compatible toute licence libre approuvée ou certifiée par la Free Software Foundation ou l''Open Source Initiative, dont le niveau de réciprocité est comparable à celui de la présente licence, sans toutefois être moindre, notamment : 1 Common Public License Version 1.0 (CPL-1.0) 2 Contrat de licence de logiciel libre CeCILL, version 2.1 (CECILL-2.1) 3 Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 (EPL-1.0) 4 European Union Public License, version 1.1 (EUPL v. 1.1) 5 GNU General Public License Version 2 (GNU GPLv2) 6 GNU General Public License Version 3 (GNU GPLv3) 5. Contributions Sous réserve d''une entente distincte, toute contribution soumise par un contributeur au concédant pour inclusion dans le logiciel sera soumise aux termes de cette licence. 6. Marques de commerce La licence n''accorde aucune permission particulière qui permettrait d''utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre que celle requise permettant d''identifier la provenance du logiciel. 7. Garanties Sauf mention contraire, le concédant distribue le logiciel sans aucune garantie, aux risques et périls de l''acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et ce, sans assurer que le logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou puisse donner un résultat quelconque. Sans lier le concédant d''une quelconque manière, rien n''empêche un licencié d''offrir ou d''exclure des garanties ou du support. 8. Responsabilité Le licencié est responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l''exercice des droits accordés par la licence. Le concédant ne saurait être tenu responsable du préjudice subi par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y sont accordés. 9. Résiliation La présente licence est résiliée de plein droit dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne sont pas exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont stipulés. Toutefois, si le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30 jours de sa prise de connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu''il s''agit du premier défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau. Pour tout défaut subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est nécessaire afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau. 10. Version de la licence Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses ayants cause ou toute personne qu''il désigne, peuvent diffuser des versions révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version recevra un numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes d''une version spécifique, c''est seulement cette version qui liera les parties à la licence. Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure, auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence lui est accordée. 11. Divers Dans la mesure où le concédant est un ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit public, créés en vertu d''une loi de l''Assemblée nationale du Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls compétents. La présente licence peut être distribuée sans conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause, doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d''identifier la provenance de la licence."
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00047,D-FSL-1.0,Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz,https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/d-fsl-1.0-de.html,f,f,f,high,-,f,-,[],[],[],[],"Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz (c) Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung Nordrhein-Westfalen 2004 Erstellt von Axel Metzger und Till Jaeger, Institut für Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software - <http://www.ifross.de>. Präambel Software ist mehr als ein Wirtschaftsgut. Sie ist die technische Grundlage der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Frage der Teilhabe der Allgemeinheit ist deswegen von besonderer Bedeutung. Herkömmlich lizenzierte Programme werden nur im Object Code vertrieben, der Nutzer darf das Programm weder verändern noch weitergeben. Das Lizenzmodell der Freien Software (synonym '"Open Source Software'") gewährt Ihnen dagegen umfassende Freiheiten im Umgang mit dem Programm. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz folgt diesem Lizenzmodell. Sie gewährt Ihnen das Recht, das Programm in umfassender Weise zu nutzen. Es ist Ihnen gestattet, das Programm nach Ihren Vorstellungen zu verändern, in veränderter oder unveränderter Form zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich zu machen. Diese Rechte werden unentgeltlich eingeräumt. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz verbindet die Rechtseinräumung allerdings mit Pflichten, die dem Zweck dienen, das freie Zirkulieren des Programms und aller veröffentlichten Fortentwicklungen zu sichern. Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie jedem, der das Programm von Ihnen erhält, eine Kopie dieser Lizenz mitliefern und den Zugriff auf den Source Code ermöglichen. Eine weitere Pflicht betrifft Fortentwicklungen des Programms. Änderungen am Programm, die Sie öffentlich verbreiten oder zugänglich machen, müssen nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz frei gegeben werden. Die Deutsche Freie Software Lizenz nimmt auf die besonderen Anforderungen des deutschen und europäischen Rechts Rücksicht. Sie ist zweisprachig gestaltet und damit auch auf den internationalen Vertrieb ausgerichtet. § 0 Definitionen Dokumentation: Die Beschreibung des Aufbaus und/oder der Struktur der Programmierung und/oder der Funktionalitäten des Programms, unabhängig davon, ob sie im Source Code oder gesondert vorgenommen wird. Lizenz: Die zwischen dem Lizenzgeber und Ihnen geschlossene Vereinbarung mit dem Inhalt der '"Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz'" bzw. das Angebot hierzu. Lizenznehmer: Jede natürliche oder juristische Person, die die Lizenz angenommen hat. Programm: Jedes Computerprogramm, das von den Rechtsinhabern nach den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz verbreitet oder öffentlich zugänglich gemacht worden ist. Object Code: Die maschinenlesbare, übersetzte Form des Programms. Öffentlich: Nicht nur an einen bestimmten Personenkreis gerichtet, der persönlich oder durch die Zugehörigkeit zu einer juristischen Person oder einem öffentlichen Träger miteinander verbunden ist. Öffentlich zugänglich machen: Die öffentliche Weitergabe des Programms in unkörperlicher Form, insbesondere das Bereithalten zum Download in Datennetzen. Rechtsinhaber: Der bzw. die Urheber oder sonstigen Inhaber der ausschließlichen Nutzungsrechte an dem Programm. Source Code: Die für Menschen lesbare, in Programmiersprache dargestellte Form des Programms. Verändern: Jede Erweiterung, Kürzung und Bearbeitung des Programms, insbesondere Weiterentwicklungen. Verbreiten: Die öffentliche Weitergabe körperlicher Vervielfältigungsstücke, insbesondere auf Datenträgern oder in Verbindung mit Hardware. Vollständiger Source Code: Der Source Code in der für die Erstellung bzw. die Bearbeitung benutzten Form zusammen mit den zur Übersetzung und Installation erforderlichen Konfigurationsdateien und Software-Werkzeugen, sofern diese in der benötigten Form nicht allgemein gebräuchlich (z.B. Standard-Kompiler) oder für jedermann lizenzgebührenfrei im Internet abrufbar sind. § 1 Rechte (1) Sie dürfen das Programm in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. (2) Sie dürfen das Programm verändern und entsprechend veränderte Versionen vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. Gestattet ist auch die Kombination des Programms oder Teilen hiervon mit anderen Programmen. (3) Sie erhalten die Rechte unentgeltlich. § 2 Pflichten beim Vertrieb (1) Wenn Sie das Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, sei es in unveränderter oder veränderter Form, sei es in einer Kombination mit anderen Programmen oder in Verbindung mit Hardware, dann müssen sie mitliefern: 1. alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die auf diese Lizenz hinweisen; 2. alle Vermerke im Source Code und/oder Object Code, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben; 3. einen für den Empfänger deutlich wahrnehmbaren Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und die Internetadresse <http://www.d-fsl.de>; 4. den vollständigen Text dieser Lizenz in deutlich wahrnehmbarer Weise. (2) Wenn bei der Installation des Programms und/oder beim Programmstart Lizenz- und/oder Vertragsbedingungen angezeigt werden, dann müssen 1. diese Lizenz, 2. ein Hinweis auf diese Lizenz und 3. ein Hinweis auf den oder die Rechtsinhaber an den ersten unter dieser Lizenz nutzbaren Programmbestandteilen ebenfalls angezeigt werden. (3) Sie dürfen die Nutzung des Programms nicht von Pflichten oder Bedingungen abhängig machen, die nicht in dieser Lizenz vorgesehen sind. (4) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet. § 3 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb veränderter Versionen (1) Veränderte Versionen des Programms dürfen Sie nur unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, so dass Dritte das veränderte Programm insgesamt unter dieser Lizenz nutzen können. (2) Wird das Programm oder ein Teil hiervon mit einem anderen Programm kombiniert, gilt auch die Kombination insgesamt als eine veränderte Version des Programms, es sei denn, das andere Programm ist formal und inhaltlich eigenständig. Ein anderes Programm ist dann als eigenständig anzusehen, wenn es die folgenden Voraussetzungen alle erfüllt: 1. Der Source Code der kombinierten Programme muss jeweils in eigenen Dateien vorhanden sein, die keine Bestandteile des anderen Teils enthalten, die über die zur Programmkombination üblichen und erforderlichen Informationen über den anderen Teil hinausgehen, wobei der Source Code des anderen Programms nicht mitgeliefert werden muss. 2. Der mit dem Programm kombinierte Teil muss auch dann sinnvoll nutzbar sein, wenn er nicht mit dem Programm kombiniert wird, und zwar entweder alleine oder mit sonstigen Programmen. Was als '"sinnvoll nutzbar'" anzusehen ist, richtet sich nach der Auffassung der betroffenen Fachkreise. Zu den betroffenen Fachkreisen gehören alle Personen, die das Programm oder Programme mit vergleichbarer Funktionalität entwickeln, benutzen, verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen. (3) Wenn Sie das Programm oder einen Teil hiervon - verändert oder unverändert - zusammen mit einem anderen Programm verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, das unter der GNU General Public License (GPL) lizenziert wird, darf das Programm auch unter den Bedingungen der GPL genutzt werden, sofern es mit dem anderen Programm ein '"derivative work'" im Sinne der GPL bildet. Dabei sollen die Hinweise auf diese Lizenz entfernt und durch einen Hinweis auf die GPL ersetzt werden. Ob bei der Zusammenstellung ein '"derivate work'" im Sinne der GPL entsteht, beurteilt sich nach Ziffer 2 b) der GPL. Diese Bestimmung lautet: '"You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.'" Die GPL kann abgerufen werden unter <http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl>. (4) Wenn Sie das Programm in einer veränderten Form verbreiten oder öffentlich zugänglich machen, müssen Sie im Source Code einen Hinweis mit den Änderungen aufnehmen und mit dem Datum der Änderung versehen. Der Hinweis muss erkennen lassen, welche Änderungen vorgenommen wurden und bestehende Vermerke, die über die Urheber des Programms Auskunft geben, übernehmen. Dies gilt unabhängig davon, ob Sie einen eigenen Urhebervermerk hinzufügen. Anstelle eines Hinweises im Source Code können Sie auch ein Versionskontrollsystem verwenden oder weiterführen, sofern dieses mitverbreitet wird oder öffentlich zugänglich ist. (5) Sie dürfen von Dritten für die Einräumung eines einfachen Nutzungsrechts an veränderten Versionen des Programms kein Entgelt verlangen. (6) Wenn Sie an der veränderten Version des Programms ein anderes Schutzrecht als ein Urheberrecht erwerben, insbesondere ein Patent oder Gebrauchsmuster, lizenzieren Sie dieses Schutzrecht für veränderte und unveränderte Versionen des Programms in dem Umfang, der erforderlich ist, um die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz wahrnehmen zu können. § 4 Weitere Pflichten beim Vertrieb im Object Code (1) Wenn Sie das Programm nur im Object Code verbreiten, dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten entweder 1. den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und bei der Verbreitung des Object Codes deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen, unter der der Source Code abgerufen werden kann oder 2. den vollständigen Source Code auf einem hierfür üblichen Datenträger unter Beachtung der §§ 2 und 3 mitverbreiten. (2) Wenn Sie das Programm im Object Code öffentlich zugänglich machen, dann müssen Sie zusätzlich zu den in § 2 und § 3 geregelten Pflichten den vollständigen Source Code im Internet öffentlich zugänglich machen und dabei deutlich auf die vollständige Internetadresse hinweisen. (3) Sofern Sie mit dem Programm eine Dokumentation erhalten haben, muss diese Dokumentation entsprechend der Absätze 1 und 2 mitgeliefert werden, es sei denn, die freie Mitlieferung der Dokumentation ist Ihnen aufgrund der Lizenz für die Dokumentation nicht gestattet. § 5 Vertragsschluss (1) Mit dieser Lizenz wird Ihnen und jeder anderen Person ein Angebot auf Abschluss eines Vertrages über die Nutzung des Programms unter den Bedingungen der Deutschen Freien Softwarelizenz unterbreitet. (2) Sie dürfen das Programm nach den jeweils anwendbaren gesetzlichen Vorschriften bestimmungsgemäß benutzen, ohne dass es der Annahme dieser Lizenz bedarf. Dieses Recht umfasst in der Europäischen Union und in den meisten anderen Rechtsordnungen insbesondere die folgenden Befugnisse: 1. das Programm ablaufen zu lassen sowie die Erstellung von hierfür erforderlichen Vervielfältigungen im Haupt- und Arbeitsspeicher; 2. das Erstellen einer Sicherungskopie; 3. die Fehlerberichtigung; 4. die Weitergabe einer rechtmäßig erworbenen körperlichen Kopie des Programms. (3) Sie erklären Ihre Zustimmung zum Abschluss dieser Lizenz, indem Sie das Programm verbreiten, öffentlich zugänglich machen, verändern oder in einer Weise vervielfältigen, die über die bestimmungsgemäße Nutzung im Sinne von Absatz 2 hinausgeht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist diese Lizenz als rechtlich verbindlicher Vertrag zwischen den Rechtsinhabern und Ihnen geschlossen, ohne dass es eines Zugangs der Annahmeerklärung bei den Rechtsinhabern bedarf. (4) Sie und jeder andere Lizenznehmer erhalten die Rechte aus dieser Lizenz direkt von den Rechtsinhabern. Eine Unterlizenzierung oder Übertragung der Rechte ist nicht gestattet. § 6 Beendigung der Rechte bei Zuwiderhandlung (1) Jede Verletzung Ihrer Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz führt zu einer automatischen Beendigung Ihrer Rechte aus dieser Lizenz. (2) Die Rechte Dritter, die das Programm oder Rechte an dem Programm von Ihnen erhalten haben, bleiben hiervon unberührt. § 7 Haftung und Gewährleistung (1) Für entgegenstehende Rechte Dritter haften die Rechtsinhaber nur, sofern sie Kenntnis von diesen Rechten hatten, ohne Sie zu informieren. (2) Die Haftung für Fehler und sonstige Mängel des Programms richtet sich nach den außerhalb dieser Lizenz getroffenen Vereinbarungen zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern oder, wenn eine solche Vereinbarung nicht existiert, nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen. § 8 Verträge mit Dritten (1) Diese Lizenz regelt nur die Beziehung zwischen Ihnen und den Rechtsinhabern. Sie ist nicht Bestandteil der Verträge zwischen Ihnen und Dritten. (2) Die Lizenz beschränkt Sie nicht in der Freiheit, mit Dritten, die von Ihnen Kopien des Programms erhalten oder Leistungen in Anspruch nehmen, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Programm stehen, Verträge beliebigen Inhalts zu schließen, sofern Sie dabei Ihren Verpflichtungen aus dieser Lizenz nachkommen und die Rechte der Dritten aus dieser Lizenz nicht beeinträchtigt werden. Insbesondere dürfen Sie für die Überlassung des Programms oder sonstige Leistungen ein Entgelt verlangen. (3) Diese Lizenz verpflichtet Sie nicht, das Programm an Dritte weiterzugeben. Es steht Ihnen frei zu entscheiden, wem Sie das Programm zugänglich machen. Sie dürfen aber die weitere Nutzung durch Dritte nicht durch den Einsatz technischer Schutzmaßnahmen, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von Kopierschutzvorrichtungen jeglicher Art, verhindern oder erschweren. Eine passwortgeschützte Zugangsbeschränkung oder die Nutzung in einem Intranet wird nicht als technische Schutzmaßnahme angesehen. § 9 Text der Lizenz (1) Diese Lizenz ist in deutscher und englischer Sprache abgefasst. Beide Fassungen sind gleich verbindlich. Es wird unterstellt, dass die in der Lizenz verwandten Begriffe in beiden Fassungen dieselbe Bedeutung haben. Ergeben sich dennoch Unterschiede, so ist die Bedeutung maßgeblich, welche die Fassungen unter Berücksichtigung des Ziels und Zwecks der Lizenz am besten miteinander in Einklang bringt. (2) Der Lizenzrat der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz kann mit verbindlicher Wirkung neue Versionen der Lizenz in Kraft setzen, soweit dies erforderlich und zumutbar ist. Neue Versionen der Lizenz werden auf der Internetseite <http://www.d-fsl.de> mit einer eindeutigen Versionsnummer veröffentlicht. Die neue Version der Lizenz erlangt für Sie verbindliche Wirkung, wenn Sie von deren Veröffentlichung Kenntnis genommen haben. Gesetzliche Rechtsbehelfe gegen die Änderung der Lizenz werden durch die vorstehenden Bestimmungen nicht beschränkt. (3) Sie dürfen diese Lizenz in unveränderter Form vervielfältigen, verbreiten und öffentlich zugänglich machen. § 10 Anwendbares Recht Auf diese Lizenz findet deutsches Recht Anwendung. Anhang: Wie unterstellen Sie ein Programm der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz? Um jedermann den Abschluss dieser Lizenz zu ermöglichen, wird empfohlen, das Programm mit folgendem Hinweis auf die Lizenz zu versehen: '"Copyright (C) 20[jj] [Name des Rechtsinhabers]. Dieses Programm kann durch jedermann gemäß den Bestimmungen der Deutschen Freien Software Lizenz genutzt werden. Die Lizenz kann unter <http://www.d-fsl.de> abgerufen werden.'""

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN '"AS-IS'" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. THE LICENSOR IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (IGO), AS DEFINED IN THE LICENSE BELOW. License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ('"LICENSE'"). THE LICENSOR (DEFINED BELOW) HOLDS COPYRIGHT AND OTHER RIGHTS IN THE WORK. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THE LICENSE. 1. Definitions a. '"IGO'" means, solely and exclusively for purposes of this License, an organization established by a treaty or other instrument governed by international law and possessing its own international legal personality. Other organizations established to carry out activities across national borders and that accordingly enjoy immunity from legal process are also IGOs for the sole and exclusive purposes of this License. IGOs may include as members, in addition to states, other entities. b. '"Work'" means the literary and/or artistic work eligible for copyright protection, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, and offered under the terms of this License. It is understood that a database, which by reason of the selection and arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation, is considered a Work. c. '"Licensor'" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License and may be, but is not necessarily, an IGO. d. '"You'" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License. e. '"License Elements'" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by the Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike. f. '"Reproduce'" means to make a copy of the Work in any manner or form, and by any means. g. '"Distribute'" means the activity of making publicly available the Work or Adaptation (or copies of the Work or Adaptation), as applicable, by sale, rental, public lending or any other known form of transfer of ownership or possession of the Work or copy of the Work. h. '"Publicly Perform'" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. '"Adaptation'" means a work derived from or based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works. Adaptations may include works such as translations, derivative works, or any alterations and arrangements of any kind involving the Work. For purposes of this License, where the Work is a musical work, performance, or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image is an Adaptation. For the avoidance of doubt, including the Work in a Collection is not an Adaptation. j. '"Collection'" means a collection of literary or artistic works or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(b) which by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. For the avoidance of doubt, a Collection will not be considered as an Adaptation. 2. Scope of this License. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright protection. 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to exercise the rights in the Work as follows: a. to Reproduce, Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce, Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and, b. to create, Reproduce, Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations, provided that You clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. This License lasts for the duration of the term of the copyright in the Work licensed by the Licensor. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(e). 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work (see section 8(a)). You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from a Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit (inclusive of any logo, trademark, official mark or official emblem) as required by Section 4(d), as requested. b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; or (iii) either the unported Creative Commons license or a ported Creative Commons license (either this or a later license version) containing the same License Elements (the '"Applicable License'"). (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. (IV) When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License. c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) any attributions that the Licensor indicates be associated with the Work as indicated in a copyright notice, (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation. The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributors to the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Licensor or others designated for attribution, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Licensor or such others. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives the right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves the right to collect such royalties. f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the honor or reputation of the Licensor where moral rights apply. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. 6. Limitation on Liability IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this License, the license granted here lasts for the duration of the term of the copyright in the Work licensed by the Licensor as stated in Section 3. Notwithstanding the above, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated below. b. If You fail to comply with this License, then this License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this License reinstates automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of You discovering the violation, or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(b) does not affect any rights the Licensor may have to seek remedies for violations of this License by You. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the Licensor. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Licensor with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). Interpretation of the scope of the rights granted by the Licensor and the conditions imposed on You under this License, this License, and the rights and conditions set forth herein shall be made with reference to copyright as determined in accordance with general principles of international law, including the above mentioned conventions. g. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon or waiver of any privileges and immunities that may apply to the Licensor or You, including immunity from the legal processes of any jurisdiction, national court or other authority. h. Where the Licensor is an IGO, any and all disputes arising under this License that cannot be settled amicably shall be resolved in accordance with the following procedure: i. Pursuant to a notice of mediation communicated by reasonable means by either You or the Licensor to the other, the dispute shall be submitted to non-binding mediation conducted in accordance with rules designated by the Licensor in the copyright notice published with the Work, or if none then in accordance with those communicated in the notice of mediation. The language used in the mediation proceedings shall be English unless otherwise agreed. ii. If any such dispute has not been settled within 45 days following the date on which the notice of mediation is provided, either You or the Licensor may, pursuant to a notice of arbitration communicated by reasonable means to the other, elect to have the dispute referred to and finally determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules designated by the Licensor in the copyright notice published with the Work, or if none then in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as then in force. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator and the language of the proceedings shall be English unless otherwise agreed. The place of arbitration shall be where the Licensor has its headquarters. The arbitral proceedings shall be conducted remotely (e.g., via telephone conference or written submissions) whenever practicable. iii. Interpretation of this License in any dispute submitted to mediation or arbitration shall be as set forth in Section 8(f), above. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of the Licensor.

Loin d’ignorer les droits de l’auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un usage créatif des oeuvres d’art.  Alors que l’usage fait du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique conduit à restreindre l’accès du public à l’oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a pour but de le favoriser.  L’intention est d’ouvrir l’accès et d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une oeuvre par le plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier les réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs avec la reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral. En effet, avec la venue du numérique, l’invention de l’internet et des logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est apparu. Il est aussi l’amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté par nombre d’artistes contemporains. Le savoir et la création sont des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour être encore véritablement du savoir et de la création. C’est à dire rester une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une application concrète. Créer c’est découvrir l’inconnu, c’est inventer le réel avant tout souci de réalisme.  Ainsi, l’objet de l’art n’est pas confondu avec l’objet d’art fini et défini comme tel. C’est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger des pratiques artistiques libérées des seules règles de l’économie de marché. DÉFINITIONS – L’oeuvre : il s’agit d’une oeuvre commune qui comprend l’oeuvre originelle ainsi que toutes les contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les copies). Elle est créée à l’initiative de l’auteur originel qui par cette licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les contributions sont faites. – L’oeuvre originelle : c’est-à-dire l’oeuvre créée par l’initiateur de l’oeuvre commune dont les copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite. – Les oeuvres conséquentes : c’est-à-dire les propositions des auteurs qui contribuent à la formation de l’oeuvre en faisant usage des droits de reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur confère la licence. – Original (source ou ressource de l’oeuvre) : exemplaire daté de l’oeuvre, de sa définition, de sa partition ou de son programme que l’auteur présente comme référence pour toutes actualisations, interprétations, copies ou reproductions ultérieures. – Copie : toute reproduction d’un original au sens de cette licence. – Auteur de l’oeuvre originelle : c’est la personne qui a créé l’oeuvre à l’origine d’une arborescence de cette oeuvre modifiée. Par cette licence, l’auteur détermine les conditions dans lesquelles ce travail se fait. – Contributeur : toute personne qui contribue à la création de l’oeuvre. Il est l’auteur d’une oeuvre originale résultant de la modification d’une copie de l’oeuvre originelle ou de la modification d’une copie d’une oeuvre conséquente. 1. OBJET Cette licence a pour objet de définir les conditions selon lesquelles vous pouvez jouir librement de cette oeuvre. 2. L’ÉTENDUE DE LA JOUISSANCE Cette oeuvre est soumise au droit d’auteur, et l’auteur par cette licence vous indique quelles sont vos libertés pour la copier, la diffuser et la modifier: 2.1 LA LIBERTÉ DE COPIER (OU DE REPRODUCTION) Vous avez la liberté de copier cette oeuvre pour un usage personnel, pour vos amis, ou toute autre personne et quelque soit la technique employée. 2.2 LA LIBERTÉ DE DIFFUSER, D’INTERPRÉTER (OU DE REPRÉSENTATION) Vous pouvez diffuser librement les copies de ces oeuvres, modifiées ou non, quel que soit le support, quel que soit le lieu, à titre onéreux ou gratuit si vous respectez toutes les conditions suivantes:  – joindre aux copies, cette licence à l’identique, ou indiquer précisément où se trouve la licence,  – indiquer au destinataire le nom de l’auteur des originaux,  – indiquer au destinataire où il pourra avoir accès aux originaux (originels et/ou conséquents). L’auteur de l’original pourra, s’il le souhaite, vous autoriser à diffuser l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies. 2.3 LA LIBERTÉ DE MODIFIER Vous avez la liberté de modifier les copies des originaux (originels et conséquents), qui peuvent être partielles ou non, dans le respect des conditions prévues à l’article 2.2 en cas de diffusion (ou représentation) de la copie modifiée. L’auteur de l’original pourra, s’il le souhaite, vous autoriser à modifier l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies. 3. L’INCORPORATION DE L’OEUVRE Tous les éléments de cette oeuvre doivent demeurer libres, c’est pourquoi il ne vous est pas permis d’intégrer les originaux (originels et conséquents) dans une autre oeuvre qui ne serait pas soumise à cette licence. 4. VOS DROITS D’AUTEUR Cette licence n’a pas pour objet de nier vos droits d’auteur sur votre contribution. En choisissant de contribuer à l’évolution de cette oeuvre, vous acceptez seulement d’offrir aux autres les mêmes droits sur votre contribution que ceux qui vous ont été accordés par cette licence. 5. LA DURÉE DE LA LICENCE Cette licence prend effet dès votre acceptation de ses dispositions. Le fait de copier, de diffuser, ou de modifier l’oeuvre constitue une acception tacite. Cette licence a pour durée la durée des droits d’auteur attachés à l’oeuvre. Si vous ne respectez pas les termes de cette licence, vous perdez automatiquement les droits qu’elle vous confère. Si le régime juridique auquel vous êtes soumis ne vous permet pas de respecter les termes de cette licence, vous ne pouvez pas vous prévaloir des libertés qu’elle confère. 6. LES DIFFÉRENTES VERSIONS DE LA LICENCE Cette licence pourra être modifiée régulièrement, en vue de son amélioration, par ses auteurs (les acteurs du mouvement « copyleft attitude ») sous la forme de nouvelles versions numérotées. Vous avez toujours le choix entre vous contenter des dispositions contenues dans la version sous laquelle la copie vous a été communiquée ou alors, vous prévaloir des dispositions d’une des versions ultérieures. 7. LES SOUS-LICENCES Les sous licences ne sont pas autorisées par la présente. Toute personne qui souhaite bénéficier des libertés qu’elle confère sera liée directement à l’auteur de l’oeuvre originelle. 8. LA LOI APPLICABLE AU CONTRAT Cette licence est soumise au droit français."
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00052,LPPL-1.0,LaTeX Project Public License v1.0,https://spdx.org/licenses/LPPL-1.0.html,f,f,t,high,基于此项目修改的部分必须重命名且开源，以其他许可证发布时必须遵循当前许可证针对衍生作品的条款,f,由于修改版必须包含原始版或者包含原始版的出处，所以它不兼容 GPL。,[],[],[],[],"LaTeX Project Public License ============================ LPPL Version 1.0 1999-03-01 Copyright 1999 LaTeX3 Project Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification is not allowed. Preamble ======== The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base LaTeX distribution is distributed. As described below you may use this licence for any software that you wish to distribute. It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if it is unrelated to TeX. To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit copyright notice giving your name and the year, together with a reference to this license. A typical example would be %% pig.sty %% Copyright 2001 M. Y. Name % This program can redistributed and/or modified under the terms % of the LaTeX Project Public License Distributed from CTAN % archives in directory macros/latex/base/lppl.txt; either % version 1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply, with: `The Program'' referring to the software `pig.sty'' and `The Copyright Holder'' referring to the person `M. Y. Name''. To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright notice for the base latex distribution. This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed and modified. Individual files may have specific further constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than those specified below. This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this file, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra restrictions. If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program under a different license. You may use the parts of the text of LPPL as a model for your own license, but your license should not directly refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that The Program is distributed under the LPPL. The LaTeX Project Public License ================================ Terms And Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification =============================================================== WARRANTY ======== There is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides The Program `as is'' without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should The Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any of the individual authors named in the source for The Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of inability to use The Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result of a failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. DISTRIBUTION ============ Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make up the distribution of The Program are distributed. In particular this means that The Program has to be distributed including its documentation if documentation was part of the original distribution. The distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file listing all the files covered by this license. If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain! The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the The Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed under the following restrictions: * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid it. See note below, under '"Conditions on individual files'". * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the file explicitly says that renaming is not required. Any such changed files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used by the original files in the distribution of The Program. * You change any `identification string'' in The Program to clearly indicate that the file is not part of the standard system. * If The Program includes an `error report address'' so that errors may be reported to The Copyright Holder, or other specified addresses, this address must be changed in any modified versions of The Program, so that reports for files not maintained by the original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the changed files. * You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version in the modified file. * You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or alternatively provide sufficient information so that the user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be able to obtain an original, unmodified copy of The Program. For example, you may specify a URL to a site that you expect will freely provide the user with a copy of The Program (either the version on which your modification is based, or perhaps a later version). * If The Program is intended to be used with, or is based on, LaTeX, then files with the following file extensions which have special meaning in LaTeX Software, have special modification rules under the license: - Files with extension `.ins'' (installation files): these files may not be modified at all because they contain the legal notices that are placed in the generated files. - Files with extension `.fd'' (LaTeX font definitions files): these files are allowed to be modified without changing the name, but only to enable use of all available fonts and to prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts. However, modified files are not allowed to be distributed in place of original files. - Files with extension `.cfg'' (configuration files): these files can be created or modified to enable easy configuration of the system. The documentation in cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate such files. The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file in The Program. ======================================================================== NOTES ===== We believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish, whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of The Program. If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst adhering to these requirements then read the document cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. Because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like LaTeX, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of non-standard versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the above restrictions. The document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details the reasons for the legal requirements detailed above. Even if The Program is unrelated to LaTeX, the argument in modguide.tex may still apply, and should be read before a modified version of The Program is distributed. Conditions on individual files ============================== The individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the general conditions on distribution and modification contained in this file. If there are any such files, the distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional files. Typical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices. * The conditions on individual files differ only in the extent of *modification* that is allowed. * The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files. Thus a (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The Program need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a distribution meets these requirements.

Version 0.9

This Motosoto Open Source License (the “License”) applies to “Community Portal Server” and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance releases of that software (“Motosoto Products”) that are distributed by Motosoto.Com B.V. (“Licensor”). Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant to this License is a “Licensed Product.” Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as “OSI Certified Open Source Software.”

This License provides that:

You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.
Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms “Licensed Product,” “Modifications,” “Contributors” and “Source Code” are defined in the License.)
You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term “Derivative Works” is defined in the License.)
By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.
You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn’t work properly or causes you any injury or damages.
If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.
If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.
You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

License Terms

Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:
Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as an executable program. “Source Code” means the preferred form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable program, or a list of differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.
Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.
Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.
Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. “Modifications” means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term “Licensed Product” shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a “Contributor”) hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:
Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.
Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.
Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.
Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).
Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an “Electronic Distribution Mechanism”). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.
Intellectual Property Matters.
Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party’s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled “LEGAL” that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.
Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (“API”) and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients’ rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the “Notice”) in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.
Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.
Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.
Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.
Versions of This License.
Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court.
New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.
Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.
Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.
Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
Termination.
Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as “Respondent”) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the “Notice Period”) unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.
Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYÃ•S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.
Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
Definition of “You” in This License. “You” throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, “you” includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty- free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor ('"Licensed Claims'") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works. 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term '"Source Code'" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine- readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 5) External Deployment. The term '"External Deployment'" means the use or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein. 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an '"Attribution Notice.'" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. 7) Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor''s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express and volitional assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Sections 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Sections 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein. 10) Mutual Termination for Patent Action.

Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

This section shall survive the termination of this License. 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.

Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work: Licensed under the EUPL V.1.0 or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. 1. Definitions. In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: − The Licence: this Licence. − The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. − Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. − The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works. − The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify. − The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. − The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence. − Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. − The Licensee or “You”: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence. − Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. 2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: − use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, − reproduce the Work, − modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, − communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, − distribute the Work or copies thereof, − lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, − sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed. The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence. 3. Communication of the Source Code The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 4. Limitations on copyright Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto. 5. Obligations of the Licensee The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, “Compatible Licence” refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. 6. Chain of Authorship The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each time You, as a Licensee, receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence. 7. Disclaimer of Warranty The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs” inherent to this type of software development. For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work. 8. Disclaimer of Liability Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 9. Additional agreements While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 10. Acceptance of the Licence The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree” placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions. Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof. 11. Information to the public In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the identification and address of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee. 12. Termination of the Licence The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence. 13. Miscellaneous Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. The European Commission may put into force translations and/or binding new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. The new version of the Licence becomes binding for You as soon as You become aware of its publication. 14. Jurisdiction Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. 15. Applicable Law This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/) 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled '"LEGAL'" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation. 5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License. Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms available. 6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE 6.1. New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses. 6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases '"ECOS'", '"eCos'", '"Red Hat'", '"RHEPL'" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS The Covered Code is a '"commercial item,'" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation,'" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis. 13.

Loin d’ignorer ces droits, la Licence Art Libre les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule l’exercice en permettant à tout un chacun de faire un usage créatif des productions de l’esprit quels que soient leur genre et leur forme d’expression. Si, en règle générale, l’application du droit d’auteur conduit à restreindre l’accès aux œuvres de l’esprit, la Licence Art Libre, au contraire, le favorise. L’intention est d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une œuvre ; créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier les possibilités de création. La Licence Art Libre permet d’avoir jouissance des œuvres tout en reconnaissant les droits et les responsabilités de chacun. Avec le développement du numérique, l’invention d’internet et des logiciels libres, les modalités de création ont évolué : les productions de l’esprit s’offrent naturellement à la circulation, à l’échange et aux transformations. Elles se prêtent favorablement à la réalisation d’œuvres communes que chacun peut augmenter pour l’avantage de tous. C’est la raison essentielle de la Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger ces productions de l’esprit selon les principes du copyleft : liberté d’usage, de copie, de diffusion, de transformation et interdiction d’appropriation exclusive. Définitions : Nous désignons par « œuvre », autant l’œuvre initiale, les œuvres conséquentes, que l’œuvre commune telles que définies ci-après : L’œuvre commune : Il s’agit d’une œuvre qui comprend l’œuvre initiale ainsi que toutes les contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les copies). Elle est créée à l’initiative de l’auteur initial qui par cette licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les contributions sont faites. L’œuvre initiale : C’est-à-dire l’œuvre créée par l’initiateur de l’œuvre commune dont les copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite. Les œuvres conséquentes : C’est-à-dire les contributions des auteurs qui participent à la formation de l’œuvre commune en faisant usage des droits de reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur confère la licence. Originaux (sources ou ressources de l’œuvre) : Chaque exemplaire daté de l’œuvre initiale ou conséquente que leurs auteurs présentent comme référence pour toutes actualisations, interprétations, copies ou reproductions ultérieures. Copie : Toute reproduction d’un original au sens de cette licence. 1- OBJET. Cette licence a pour objet de définir les conditions selon lesquelles vous pouvez jouir librement de l’œuvre. 2. L’ÉTENDUE DE LA JOUISSANCE. Cette œuvre est soumise au droit d’auteur, et l’auteur par cette licence vous indique quelles sont vos libertés pour la copier, la diffuser et la modifier. 2.1 LA LIBERTÉ DE COPIER (OU DE REPRODUCTION). Vous avez la liberté de copier cette œuvre pour vous, vos amis ou toute autre personne, quelle que soit la technique employée. 2.2 LA LIBERTÉ DE DIFFUSER (INTERPRÉTER, REPRÉSENTER, DISTRIBUER). Vous pouvez diffuser librement les copies de ces œuvres, modifiées ou non, quel que soit le support, quel que soit le lieu, à titre onéreux ou gratuit, si vous respectez toutes les conditions suivantes : 1. joindre aux copies cette licence à l’identique ou indiquer précisément où se trouve la licence ; 2. indiquer au destinataire le nom de chaque auteur des originaux, y compris le vôtre si vous avez modifié l’œuvre ; 3. indiquer au destinataire où il pourrait avoir accès aux originaux (initiaux et/ou conséquents). Les auteurs des originaux pourront, s’ils le souhaitent, vous autoriser à diffuser l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies. 2.3 LA LIBERTÉ DE MODIFIER. Vous avez la liberté de modifier les copies des originaux (initiaux et conséquents) dans le respect des conditions suivantes : 1. celles prévues à l’article 2.2 en cas de diffusion de la copie modifiée ; 2. indiquer qu’il s’agit d’une œuvre modifiée et, si possible, la nature de la modification ; 3. diffuser cette œuvre conséquente avec la même licence ou avec toute licence compatible ; 4. Les auteurs des originaux pourront, s’ils le souhaitent, vous autoriser à modifier l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies. 3. DROITS CONNEXES. Les actes donnant lieu à des droits d’auteur ou des droits voisins ne doivent pas constituer un obstacle aux libertés conférées par cette licence. C’est pourquoi, par exemple, les interprétations doivent être soumises à la même licence ou une licence compatible. De même, l’intégration de l’œuvre à une base de données, une compilation ou une anthologie ne doit pas faire obstacle à la jouissance de l’œuvre telle que définie par cette licence. 4. L’ INTÉGRATION DE L’ŒUVRE. Toute intégration de cette œuvre à un ensemble non soumis à la LAL doit assurer l’exercice des libertés conférées par cette licence. Si l’œuvre n’est plus accessible indépendamment de l’ensemble, alors l’intégration n’est possible qu’à condition que l’ensemble soit soumis à la LAL ou une licence compatible. 5. CRITÈRES DE COMPATIBILITÉ. Une licence est compatible avec la LAL si et seulement si : 1. elle accorde l’autorisation de copier, diffuser et modifier des copies de l’œuvre, y compris à des fins lucratives, et sans autres restrictions que celles qu’impose le respect des autres critères de compatibilité ; 2. elle garantit la paternité de l’œuvre et l’accès aux versions antérieures de l’œuvre quand cet accès est possible ; 3. elle reconnaît la LAL également compatible (réciprocité) ; 4. elle impose que les modifications faites sur l’œuvre soient soumises à la même licence ou encore à une licence répondant aux critères de compatibilité posés par la LAL. 6. VOS DROITS INTELLECTUELS. La LAL n’a pas pour objet de nier vos droits d’auteur sur votre contribution ni vos droits connexes. En choisissant de contribuer à l’évolution de cette œuvre commune, vous acceptez seulement d’offrir aux autres les mêmes autorisations sur votre contribution que celles qui vous ont été accordées par cette licence. Ces autorisations n’entraînent pas un dessaisissement de vos droits intellectuels. 7. VOS RESPONSABILITÉS. La liberté de jouir de l’œuvre tel que permis par la LAL (liberté de copier, diffuser, modifier) implique pour chacun la responsabilité de ses propres faits. 8. LA DURÉE DE LA LICENCE. Cette licence prend effet dès votre acceptation de ses dispositions. Le fait de copier, de diffuser, ou de modifier l’œuvre constitue une acceptation tacite.  Cette licence a pour durée la durée des droits d’auteur attachés à l’œuvre. Si vous ne respectez pas les termes de cette licence, vous perdez automatiquement les droits qu’elle vous confère. Si le régime juridique auquel vous êtes soumis ne vous permet pas de respecter les termes de cette licence, vous ne pouvez pas vous prévaloir des libertés qu’elle confère. 9. LES DIFFÉRENTES VERSIONS DE LA LICENCE. Cette licence pourra être modifiée régulièrement, en vue de son amélioration, par ses auteurs (les acteurs du mouvement Copyleft Attitude) sous la forme de nouvelles versions numérotées.  Vous avez toujours le choix entre vous contenter des dispositions contenues dans la version de la LAL sous laquelle la copie vous a été communiquée ou alors, vous prévaloir des dispositions d’une des versions ultérieures. 10. LES SOUS-LICENCES. Les sous-licences ne sont pas autorisées par la présente. Toute personne qui souhaite bénéficier des libertés qu’elle confère sera liée directement aux auteurs de l’œuvre commune. 11. LE CONTEXTE JURIDIQUE. Cette licence est rédigée en référence au droit français et à la Convention de Berne relative au droit d’auteur."

If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software. 1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Computer, Inc. ('"Apple'") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as '"Original Code'" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 1.2 (or subsequent version thereof) ('"License'"). As used in this License: 1.1 '"Applicable Patent Rights'" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code. 1.2 '"Contributor'" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications. 1.3 '"Covered Code'" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. 1.4 '"Deploy'" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner. 1.5 '"Larger Work'" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. 1.6 '"Modifications'" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and (d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. 2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code. 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License: (a) You hereby grant to Apple and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple''s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and (b) You hereby grant to Apple and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify or have modified (for Apple and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form, through multiple tiers of distribution. 4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. 5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion. 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ('"Additional Terms'") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient''s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE''S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS '"APPLE'" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple''s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names '"Apple'", '"Apple Computer'", '"Mac OS X'", '"Mac OS X Server'", '"QuickTime'", '"QuickTime Streaming Server'" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively '"Apple Marks'") or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple''s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html. 11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ('"Apple Modifications'"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 12. Termination. 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple. 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 13. Miscellaneous. 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item'" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or amongYou, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty- free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple''s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following: 2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance: (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6. 2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions: (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site). 2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. 2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code. 3\. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple''s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above. 4\. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. 5\. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion. 6\. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ('"Additional Terms'") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient''s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7\. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 8\. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE''S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS '"APPLE'" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. 9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple''s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). 10\. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names '"Apple'", '"Apple Computer'", '"Mac'", '"Mac OS'", '"QuickTime'", '"QuickTime Streaming Server'" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively '"Apple Marks'") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple''s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html. 11\. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ('"Apple Modifications'"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 12\. Termination. 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance. 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 13\. Miscellaneous. 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item'" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais. EXHIBIT A. '"Portions Copyright (c) 1999-2003 Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 7\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

Upon such final determination being made, if Apple is legally able, without the payment of a fee or royalty, to resume use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Affected Original Code, Apple will lift the suspension of rights to the Affected Original Code by posting a notice to such effect on the Apple web site that is used for implementation of this License. If Apple suspends Your rights to Affected Original Code, nothing in this License shall be construed to restrict You, at Your option and subject to applicable law, from replacing the Affected Original Code with non-infringing code or independently negotiating for necessary rights from such third party. 9.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple''s total liability to You for all damages under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names '"Apple'", '"Apple Computer'", '"Mac OS X'", '"Mac OS X Server'" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively '"Apple Marks'") and no Apple Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple''s third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html. 11. Ownership. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ('"Apple Modifications'"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. Apple''s development, use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of Covered Code will not be subject to this License. 12. Termination. 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple. 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. Neither party will be liable to the other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party. 13. Miscellaneous. 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item'" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 13.6 Dispute Resolution.

This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

Notice
This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting:

- firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to authors and the holders of economic rights over software.
- secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.
The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C : CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):

Commissariat à l''Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an '"open source'" distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software''s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user''s attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software''s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

Licensor: means the Holder, or any or all other individual or legal entity, that distributes the Software under the Agreement.

Contributions: mean any or all modifications, corrections, translations, adaptations and/or new functionalities integrated into the Software by any or all Contributor, and the Static Modules.

Module: means a set of sources files including their documentation that, once compiled in executable form, enables supplementary functionalities or services to be developed in addition to those offered by the Software.

Dynamic Module: means any or all module, created by the Contributor, that is independent of the Software, so that this module and the Software are in two different executable forms that are run in separate address spaces, with one calling the other when they are run.

Static Module: means any or all module, created by the Contributor and connected to the Software by a static link that makes their object codes interdependent. This module and the Software to which it is connected, are combined in a single executable.

Parties: mean both the Licensee and the Licensor.

These expressions may be used both in singular and plural form.

Definitions: '"Package'" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. '"Standard Version'" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below. '"Copyright Holder'" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. '"You'" is you, if you''re thinking about copying or distributing this Package. '"Distribution fee'" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to another party. '"Freely Available'" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific way. 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications, by mail order. 5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose for that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use this Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package''s interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded. 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called '"undump'" or '"unexec'" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package. 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package''s interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package. 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 10.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. ` ### `1. DEFINITIONS` '"Contribution'" means: 1. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ('"IBM'"), the Original Program, and 2. in the case of each Contributor, 1. changes to the Program, and 2. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution ''originates'' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor''s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. '"Contributor'" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program. '"Licensed Patents '" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. '"Original Program'" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. '"Program'" means the Original Program and Contributions. '"Recipient'" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. ### 2\. GRANT OF RIGHTS 1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. ### 3\. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 2. its license agreement: 1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 4. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: 1. it must be made available under this Agreement; and 2. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: > Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and > others. All Rights Reserved. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. ### 4\. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ('"Commercial Contributor'") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ('"Indemnified Contributor'") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively '"Losses'") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor''s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. ### 5\. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. ### 6\. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ### 7\. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient''s patent(s), then such Recipient''s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient''s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party''s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled '"LEGAL'''' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor''s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor''s Modifications are Contributor''s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. Borland Software Corporation (''''Interbase'''') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Interbase. No one other than Interbase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''''Mozilla'''', ''''MOZILLAPL'''', ''''MOZPL'''', ''''Netscape'''', '"MPL'", ''''NPL'", '"Interbase'", '"ISC'", '"IB'''' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 6.4 Origin of the Interbase Public License. The Interbase public license is based on the Mozilla Public License V 1.1 with the following changes: The license is published by Borland Software Corporation. Only Borland Software Corporation can modify the terms applicable to Covered Code. The license can be modified used for code which is not already governed by this license. Modified versions of the license must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape?s or Interbase Software?s license and must include a description of changes from the Interbase Public License. The name of the license in Exhibit A is the '"Interbase Public License'". The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has been removed. Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted. Exhibit A, Netscape Public License has been deleted A new amendment (II) has been added, describing the required and restricted rights to use the trademarks of Borland Software Corporation 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'''' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as '"Participant'") alleging that: (a) such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant''s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a ''''commercial item,'''' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''''commercial computer software'''' and ''''commercial computer software documentation,'''' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as '"Multiple-Licensed'". '"Multiple-Licensed'" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author''s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the '"Lesser'" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user''s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a '"work based on the library'" and a '"work that uses the library'". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called '"this License'"). Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". A '"library'" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The '"Library'", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A '"work based on the Library'" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term '"modification'".) '"Source code'" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library''s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a '"work that uses the Library'". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a '"work that uses the Library'" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a '"work that uses the library'". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a '"work that uses the Library'" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a '"work that uses the Library'" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer''s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable '"work that uses the Library'", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user''s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the '"work that uses the Library'" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and '"any later version'", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the '"copyright'" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library''s name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a '"copyright disclaimer'" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker. <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice That''s all there is to it!"

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Governed Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Governed Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by RSV and including the name of RSV in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Governed Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. 3.4.1. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled '"LEGAL'" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained. In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of your Modifications. 3.4.2. Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'' rights relating to Governed Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of RSV or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by RSV or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Governed Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of theterms of this License with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Trademark Usage. 5.1. Advertising Materials. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: '"This product includes software developed by Ricoh Silicon Valley, Inc.'" 5.2. Endorsements. The names '"Ricoh,'" '"Ricoh Silicon Valley,'" and '"RSV'" must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of RSV. 5.3. Product Names. Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called '"Ricoh'" nor may the word '"Ricoh'" appear in their names without the prior written permission of RSV. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. RSV may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Governed Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Governed Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by RSV. No one other than RSV has the right to modify the terms applicable to Governed Code created under this License. 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. GOVERNED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE GOVERNED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY GOVERNED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT RSV OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY GOVERNED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. Termination. 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Governed Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate patent infringement litigation against RSV or a Contributor (RSV or the Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as '"Participant'") alleging that: (a) such Participant''s Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of the Original Code or the Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Original Code or the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device provided to You by the Participant, other than such Participant''s Original Code or Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Original Code or the Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant''s Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL RSVS LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY DANGEROUS APPLICATION THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE OR MASS DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED CODE. 10. U.S. Government End Users. The Governed Code is a '"commercial item,'" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation,'" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12. Responsibility for Claims. Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1. DEFINITIONS '"Contribution'" means: 1. in the case of ORGANIZATION ('"OWNER'"), the Original Program, and 2. in the case of each Contributor, 1. changes to the Program, and 2. additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program were added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor''s behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as Contributions. '"Contributor'" means OWNER and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the Program. '"Distributor'" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof. '"Licensed Patents'" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. '"Original Program'" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by OWNER, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. '"Program'" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof '"Recipient'" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that: 1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 2. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor''s own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and 3. if distributed under Distributor''s own license agreement, such license agreement: 1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and 3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party. B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: Copyright (C) YEAR, ORGANIZATION and others. All Rights Reserved. C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked. 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor ('"Commercial Distributor'") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor ('"Indemnified Contributor'") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively '"Losses'") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor''s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages. 5. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. EXPORT CONTROL Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries). 8. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient''s patent(s), then such Recipient''s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient''s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient''s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of Licensor''s copyrights cover the Original Code, to do the following: 2.1 You may reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance: (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Licensor as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6; (c) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; (d) You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); and (e) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code. You must also include the Object Code Notice set forth in Exhibit A in the '"about'" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed, including any packaging materials. 2.2 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to make, use, sell, import or offer for sale the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire such license(s). 2.3 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License (via downloading or using Covered Code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this License), a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive patent license under Licensor''s Applicable Patent Rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Covered Code, provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this License. 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License: (a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor''s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and (b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution. (c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor. 4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications. 4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above. 4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way wtih the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software. 4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this License. 5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware. 5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor ('"Licensor Marks'" defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C. 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ('"Additional Terms'") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient''s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR''S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS '"LICENSOR'" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor''s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00). 10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor ('"Licensor Modifications'"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 11. Termination 11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit); (d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit). 11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 12. Miscellaneous. 12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item'" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary authorizations. 12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.

PREAMBLE The Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness. In short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a \'"third party\'". While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base. While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RPL is found in two definitions: \'"Deploy\'" and \'"Required Components\'". Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software. Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they''re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it. In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document. LICENSE TERMS 1.0 General; Applicability & Definitions. This Reciprocal Public License Version 1.5 (\'"License\'") applies to any programs or other works as well as any and all updates or maintenance releases of said programs or works (\'"Software\'") not already covered by this License which the Software copyright holder (\'"Licensor\'") makes available containing a License Notice (hereinafter defined) from the Licensor specifying or allowing use or distribution under the terms of this License. As used in this License: 1.1 \'"Contributor\'" means any person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of an Extension. 1.2 \'"Deploy\'" means to use, Serve, sublicense or distribute Licensed Software other than for Your internal Research and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Licensed Software within Your business or organization other than for Research and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Licensed Software by You to any third party in any form or manner. 1.3 \'"Derivative Works\'" as used in this License is defined under U.S. copyright law. 1.4 \'"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\'" means a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data such as download from an FTP server or web site, where such mechanism is publicly accessible. 1.5 \'"Extensions\'" means any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components as those terms are defined in this License. 1.6 \'"License\'" means this Reciprocal Public License. 1.7 \'"License Notice\'" means any notice contained in EXHIBIT A. 1.8 \'"Licensed Software\'" means any Software licensed pursuant to this License.

Should you be unable to notify Licensor directly, you must provide notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, or web sites where a search engine would reasonably be expected to index them. 6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor. 7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Software created under this License. 7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications to this License be limited to alteration of EXHIBIT A purely for purposes of adjusting the Notice You require of licensees, You may continue to refer to Your License as the Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL. 8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED, THAT ANY CONTRIBUTOR''S EXTENSIONS MEET ANY STANDARD OF COMPATIBILITY OR DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ('"HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES'"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. 11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed Software. 12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. 12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as '"Respondent'") alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the '"Notice Period'") unless within that Notice Period You either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. 12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 13.0 Miscellaneous. 13.1 U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Software is a '"commercial item,'" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation,'" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Software with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor, or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance, or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor''s right to acquire, license, develop, subcontract, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Extensions that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute. 13.4 Consent To Breach Not Waiver. Failure by Licensor or Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. 13.5 Severability. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 13.6 Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You cannot use, modify, or distribute the software. 13.7 Export Restrictions. You may be restricted with respect to downloading or otherwise acquiring, exporting, or reexporting the Licensed Software or any underlying information or technology by United States and other applicable laws and regulations. By downloading or by otherwise obtaining the Licensed Software, You are agreeing to be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 13.8 Arbitration, Jurisdiction & Venue. This License shall be governed by Colorado law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any dispute relating to this License shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association. You further agree that Adams County, Colorado USA is proper venue and grant such arbitration proceeding jurisdiction as may be appropriate for purposes of resolving any dispute under this License. Judgement upon any award made in arbitration may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall award attorney''s fees and costs of arbitration to the prevailing party. Should either party find it necessary to enforce its arbitration award or seek specific performance of such award in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney''s fees and costs. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Software or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 13.9 Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. EXHIBIT A The Notice below must appear in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute of the Licensed Software or any Extensions thereto, except as may be modified as allowed under the terms of Section 7.1 Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.

                  Version 1.2, November 2002


 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The '"Document'", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as '"you'".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".)  To '"Preserve the Title'"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections Entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
Entitled '"Endorsements'".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", or '"History'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU
    Free Documentation License'".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the '"with...Texts.'" line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The '"Document'", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as '"you'".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".)  To '"Preserve the Title'"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections Entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
Entitled '"Endorsements'".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", or '"History'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU
    Free Documentation License'".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the '"with...Texts.'" line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software."

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The '"Document'", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as '"you'".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".)  To '"Preserve the Title'"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections Entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
Entitled '"Endorsements'".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", or '"History'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU
    Free Documentation License'".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the '"with...Texts.'" line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software."

 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The '"Document'", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as '"you'".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".)  To '"Preserve the Title'"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections Entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
Entitled '"Endorsements'".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
'"Dedications'", or '"History'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU
    Free Documentation License'".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the '"with...Texts.'" line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The '"Document'", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as '"you'". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'", '"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".) To '"Preserve the Title'" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the '"History'" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"History'" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled '"History'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"Acknowledgements'", and any sections Entitled '"Dedications'". You must delete all sections Entitled '"Endorsements'". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled '"Acknowledgements'", '"Dedications'", or '"History'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU Free Documentation License'". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the '"with...Texts.'" line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The '"Document'", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as '"you'". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section '"Entitled XYZ'" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as '"Acknowledgements'", '"Dedications'", '"Endorsements'", or '"History'".) To '"Preserve the Title'" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section '"Entitled XYZ'" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B.

C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled '"History'", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the '"History'" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled '"Endorsements'". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"Endorsements'" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.

AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an '"aggregate'" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit.

By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the data are free for all their users. This License, the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources, applies to some specially designated linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources (also called '"this License'"). Each licensee is addressed as '"you'". A '"linguistic resource'" means a collection of data about language prepared so as to be used with application programs. The '"Linguistic Resource'", below, refers to any such work which has been distributed under these terms. A '"work based on the Linguistic Resource'" means either the Linguistic Resource or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Linguistic Resource or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term '"modification'".) '"Legible form'" for a linguistic resource means the preferred form of the resource for making modifications to it. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Linguistic Resource is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Linguistic Resource (independent of the use of the Linguistic Resource in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the program that uses the Linguistic Resource does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Linguistic Resource. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a linguistic resource. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Linguistic Resource. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Linguistic Resource with the Linguistic Resource (or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Linguistic Resource, but is designed to work with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called a '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, combining a '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates a package that is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it contains portions of the Linguistic Resource), rather than a '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'". If the package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource, you may distribute the package under the terms of Section 4. Any works containing that package also fall under Section 4. 4. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) to produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic Resource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the package for the customer''s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the package that the Linguistic Resource is used in it and that the Linguistic Resource and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the package during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Linguistic Resource among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine-readable legible form of the Linguistic Resource including whatever changes were used in the package (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the package contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the complete machine-readable '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Linguistic Resource and then encrypt it to produce a modified package containing the modified Linguistic Resource. b) Use a suitable mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource. A suitable mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version of the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the package was made with. c) Accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. If the package includes an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, the required form of the '"work that uses the Linguistic Resource'" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the package from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that you distribute. 5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Linguistic Resource or works based on it. 7. Each time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Linguistic Resource. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free resource distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute resources through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Linguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Linguistic Resource specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and '"any later version'", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Linguistic Resource does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. NO WARRANTY 12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Permission is given for redistribution, copy, and modification provided
   following conditions are met.
   1. Do not remove copyright clause.
   2. Distribution shall conform:
    a. The content of redistribution (i.e., source code, documentation,
       and reference guide for programmers) shall include original contents.
       If contents are modified, the document clearly indicating
       the fact of modification must be included.
    b. If LHa is redistributed with added values, you must put your best
       effort to include them (Translator comment: If read literally,
       original Japanese was unclear what '"them'" means here.  But
       undoubtedly this '"them'" means source code for the added value
       portion and this is a typical Japanese sloppy writing style to
       abbreviate as such)  Also the document clearly indicating that
       added value was added must be included.
    c. Binary only distribution is not allowed (including added value
       ones.)
   3. You need to put effort to distribute the latest version (This is not
      your duty).
      NB: Distribution on Internet is free.  Please notify me by e-mail or
      other means prior to the distribution if distribution is done through
      non-Internet media (Magazine, CDROM etc.)  If not, make sure to Email
      me later.
   4. Any damage caused by the existence and use of this program will not
      be compensated.
   5. Author will not be responsible to correct errors even if program is
      defective.
   6. This program, either as a part of this or as a whole of this, may be
      included into other programs.  In this case, that program is not LHa
      and can not call itself LHa.
   7. For commercial use, in addition to above conditions, following
      condition needs to be met.
      a.  The program whose content is mainly this program can not be used
          commercially.
      b.  If the recipient of commercial use deems inappropriate as a
          program user, you must not distribute.
      c.  If used as a method for the installation, you must not force
          others to use this program.  In this case, commercial user will
          perform its work while taking full responsibility of its outcome.
      d.  If added value is done under the commercial use by using this
          program, commercial user shall provide its support.
(Osamu Aoki also comments:
   Here '"commercial'" may be interpreted as '"for-fee'".  '"Added value'" seems
   to mean '"feature enhancement'".  )
Translated License Statement by Tsugio Okamoto (translated by

   It''s free to distribute on the network, but if you distribute for
   the people who cannot access the network (by magazine or CD-ROM),
   please send E-Mail (Inter-Net address) to the author before the
   distribution. That''s well where this software is appeard.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document '"'"free'"'" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of '"'"copyleft'"'", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The '"'"Document'"'", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as '"'"you'"'". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A '"'"Modified Version'"'" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A '"'"Secondary Section'"'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The '"'"Invariant Sections'"'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The '"'"Cover Texts'"'" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A '"'"Transparent'"'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not '"'"Transparent'"'" is called '"'"Opaque'"'". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The '"'"Title Page'"'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, '"'"Title Page'"'" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The '"'"publisher'"'" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section '"'"Entitled XYZ'"'" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as '"'"Acknowledgements'"'", '"'"Dedications'"'", '"'"Endorsements'"'", or '"'"History'"'".) To '"'"Preserve the Title'"'" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section '"'"Entitled XYZ'"'" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled '"'"History'"'", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled '"'"History'"'" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the '"'"History'"'" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled '"'"Acknowledgements'"'" or '"'"Dedications'"'", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled '"'"Endorsements'"'". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled '"'"Endorsements'"'" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled '"'"Endorsements'"'", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled '"'"History'"'" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled '"'"History'"'"; likewise combine any sections Entitled '"'"Acknowledgements'"'", and any sections Entitled '"'"Dedications'"'". You must delete all sections Entitled '"'"Endorsements'"'". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an '"'"aggregate'"'" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation''s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled '"'"Acknowledgements'"'", '"'"Dedications'"'", or '"'"History'"'", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License '"'"or any later version'"'" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy''s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING '"'"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'"'" (or '"'"MMC Site'"'") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A '"'"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'"'" (or '"'"MMC'"'") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. '"'"CC-BY-SA'"'" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. '"'"Incorporate'"'" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is '"'"eligible for relicensing'"'" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"'"GNU Free Documentation License'"'". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the '"'"with...Texts.'"'" line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00113,GFDL-1.1-or-later,GNU Free Documentation License v1.1 or later,https://spdx.org/licenses/GFDL-1.1-or-later.html,f,t,t,medium,该协议主要针对文本文件，需要开源,f,-,[],[],[],[],"GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.1, March 2000 Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The '"Document'", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as '"you'". A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled '"History'", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the '"History'" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. In any section entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'", preserve the section''s title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section entitled '"Endorsements'". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section as '"Endorsements'" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled '"History'" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled '"History'"; likewise combine any sections entitled '"Acknowledgements'", and any sections entitled '"Dedications'". You must delete all sections entitled '"Endorsements.'" 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an '"aggregate'", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU Free Documentation License'". If you have no Invariant Sections, write '"with no Invariant Sections'" instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write '"no Front-Cover Texts'" instead of '"Front-Cover Texts being LIST'"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software."

     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document '"free'" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of '"copyleft'", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The '"Document'", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as '"you'".

A '"Modified Version'" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A '"Secondary Section'" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document''s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The '"Invariant Sections'" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The '"Cover Texts'" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A '"Transparent'" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not '"Transparent'" is called '"Opaque'".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The '"Title Page'" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, '"Title Page'" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work''s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document''s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled '"History'", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   preserve the section''s title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled '"Endorsements'".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as '"Endorsements'"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled '"Endorsements'", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
entitled '"Endorsements.'"


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an '"aggregate'", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License '"or any later version'" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled '"GNU
      Free Documentation License'".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write '"with no Invariant Sections'"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write '"no Front-Cover Texts'" instead of
'"Front-Cover Texts being LIST'"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software."

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document''s license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled '"History'", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled '"History'" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the '"History'" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled '"Acknowledgements'" or '"Dedications'",
   preserve the section''s title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version''s license notice.

nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled '"History'"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
'"History'"; likewise combine any sections entitled '"Acknowledgements'",
and any sections entitled '"Dedications'".  You must delete all sections
entitled '"Endorsements.'"


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an '"aggregate'", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document''s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work: Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. 1\. Definitions In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: \- The Licence: this Licence. \- The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. \- Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. \- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works. \- The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify. \- The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. \- The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence. \- Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. \- The Licensee or '"You'": any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence. \- Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. 2\. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: \- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, \- reproduce the Work, \- modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, \- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, \- distribute the Work or copies thereof, \- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, \- sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed. The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence. 3\. Communication of the Source Code The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 4\. Limitations on copyright Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto. 5\. Obligations of the Licensee The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, '"Compatible Licence'" refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. 6\. Chain of Authorship The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence. 7\. Disclaimer of Warranty The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or '"bugs'" inherent to this type of software development. For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an '"as is'" basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work. 8\. Disclaimer of Liability Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 9\. Additional agreements While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 10\. Acceptance of the Licence The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon '"I agree'" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions. Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof. 11\. Information to the public In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee. 12\. Termination of the Licence The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence. 13\. Miscellaneous Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. 14\. Jurisdiction Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. 15\. Applicable Law This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office. This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: \- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee; \- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country."

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa00119,HESSLA,Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement,https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:HESSLA,f,f,t,medium,-,f,-,[],[],[],[],"TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION

0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in
this License Agreement, have the following meanings:

0.1 Author: '"Author'" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original
Work (the '"Program'") released by the Author under this License
Agreement.

0.2 Copy: '"Copy'" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a
copy according to copyright law, without limitation. A '"copy'" does not
become anything other than a '"copy'" merely because, for example, a
governmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a
part of it for another employee of the same institution or
Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer
to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made
on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental
Entity.

0.3 Derivative Work: A '"Derivative Work'" or '"work based on the
Program'" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term '"modification.'"). In the
unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual
definition of '"Derivative Work'" is later determined by any tribunal or
dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of
'"derivative work'" under the copyright law of any country, then the
broadest and most encompassing possible definition either the
contractual definition of '"Derivative Work,'" or any broader and more
encompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control. Acceptance
of this contractually-defined scope of the term '"Derivative Work'" is a
mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered
by this License Agreement.

0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
the Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License Agreement.

0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms
'"this License'" or '"this License Agreement'" shall mean The Hactivismo
Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent
version made applicable under the terms of Section 15.

0.5 Licensee: The term '"Licensee'" shall mean You or any other
Licensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.

0.6 Original Work: '"Original Work'" shall mean a Program or other work
of authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.

0.7 Program: The '"Program,'" to which this License Agreement applies,
is the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer
software) released by the Author under this License Agreement.

0.8 Qualified Licensee: A '"Qualified Licensee'" means a Licensee that
remains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this
License Agreement. You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any
time, You violate any terms of this License Agreement. Neither the
Program nor any Software based on the Program may be copied,
distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for
Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee
other than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and
conditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each
cumulative violation as set forth herein. Loss of the status of
Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the
License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits
that Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to
additional remedies for all violations occurring after the first
violation.

0.9 Software: '"Software'" or '"the Software'" shall mean the Program, any
Derivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any
modified version of the Program or portion thereof, without
limitation.

0.10 Source Code: The term '"Source Code'" shall mean the preferred form
of a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all
available documentation describing how to access and modify that
Program or Original Work.

0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the
Source Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the
Source Code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

0.10.2 '"Object Code:'" Because of certain peculiarities of current
export-control rules, '"object code'" of the Program, or any modified
version of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must
not be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the
distribution of the Source Code. The '"Source Code'" shall be understood
as the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the '"object
code'" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such
export distribution.

0.11 Strong Cryptography: '"Strong Cryptography'" shall mean
cryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation)
a 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key
size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for
AES and similar symmetric ciphers.

0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term '"Substandard
Key-Selection Technique'" shall mean a method or technique to cause
encryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by
(i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii)
employing a selection process that selects among only a subset of
possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys
that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about
the cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following
illustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition:

0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the
encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more
prime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or
concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime
number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime
numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime
numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for
example, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security),
and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes
that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a
secure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the
primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If
there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security
associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the
cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements
of Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection
technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for
secure use of the cryptosystem.

0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the
encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random
integer, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more
mathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at
random from the largest possible set of all possible integers
consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It
shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers
(e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could
not set 200 of the 256 bits as '"0,'" and randomly generate only the
remaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of
using the full 256 bits).

0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote
security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic
method(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating
eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM
telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at
'"0,'" thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of
65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce
the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a
less-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and
will violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed
in any Software.

0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that
have violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified
Licensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of
this License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each
successive violation), is referred to as '"You.'"

0.13.1 Governmental Entity: '"You'" explicitly includes any and all
'"Governmental Entities,'" without limitation. '"Governmental Entity'" or
'"Governmental Entities,'" when used in this License Agreement, shall
mean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and
without limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal
governments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other
such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation,
governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations,
and the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the
European Union, and entities through which one or more governments
perform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in
coordination, cooperation or unison.

0.13.2 Governmental Person: '"You'" also explicitly includes
'"Governmental Persons.'" The terms '"Governmental Person'" or
'"Governmental Persons,'" when used in this License Agreement, shall
mean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors
and agents of any Governmental Entity.

1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to
any Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a
notice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the
terms of this License Agreement. The preferred manner of placing such
a notice is to include the following statement immediately after the
copyright notice for such an Original Work:

    '"Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License
    Agreement, Version 0.1'"

2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By
Anyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the
special case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying,
modification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any
Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions
of this License Agreement.

2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person
to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it
(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such
person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee
subject to all its terms and conditions.

2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have
accepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its
terms and conditions.

2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or
transfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee
that has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to
all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers
an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy
the Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the
Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License
Agreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of
a copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient
Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access,
use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the
terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees
is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a
copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting
the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee''s
obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or
access.

3. '"Qualified Licensee'" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any
Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied,
distributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for
Your own purposes, unless You are a '"Qualified Licensee.'" To remain a
Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms
and conditions of this License Agreement.

4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:

4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any
copy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your
rights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative
remedies for each successive violation that may be available to the
Author. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You
(and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License
Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees,
will not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or
restricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to
the time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License
Agreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify,
distribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released
under this License Agreement. However, nothing else grants You
permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in
object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify,
or to distribute the Program or any Software based on the
Program. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this
License Agreement. Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use,
copying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this
License Agreement by You.

4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or
Derivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute,
modify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and
conditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility
of the Author.

5. Grant of Source Code License.

5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises
and agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to
provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at
the request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this
obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of
the most current version of the Program in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
You for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by
publishing the address of that information repository in a notice
immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the
Program. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not
necessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code
accompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of
compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source
Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have
(for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current,
copy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You
from exporting copies to others without violating this license, see
Section 8).

5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a
Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License
Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the
following:

5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;

5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit
or modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative
Works;

5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work
and/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of
Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be
licensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform
all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.

6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You
remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this
License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the
following:

6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;

6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon
Software that itself is based on the Program;

6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by
distributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must
be ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program
and Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the
Program or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed
under this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all
recipients of the terms of this License Agreement;

6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;

6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and

6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the
Program (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee).

7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You
remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this
License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement,
under patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are
embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author ('"Licensed Claims'")
to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the
proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any
Derivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license
under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale
Derivative Works.

8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License
Agreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property
of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is
granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent
claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7. No right
is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included
in the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted
to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms
from this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative
Work that Author otherwise would have a right to License.

8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author
(in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo,
the name '"Hacktivismo'"), nor the names of contributors who helped
produce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of
the Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the
Program, without specific prior written permission of the
Author. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any
contributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or
promote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement
by any person other than Hacktivismo.

9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may
modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You
are a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or
prepare or distribute Derivative Works (including permission to
prepare and/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections
5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the
following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive):

9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;

9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively
when run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that
users may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and
telling the user how to view a copy of this License
Agreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
not normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.);

9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or
distributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original
Work, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the
security of the Software or the end-user''s expectations of privacy,
anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including
(without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any
'"backdoor,'" escrow mechanism, '"spy-ware,'" or surveillance techniques
or methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;

9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or
distributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security,
privacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and/or trust methods or
techniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that
includes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques
in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.

9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or
distributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection
technique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique.

9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit
or communicate any symmetric key, any '"private key'" if an asymmetric
cryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it
otherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person
other than the end-user who generated the key, without the active
consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or
symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be
stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading
(at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other
techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is
even stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.

10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.

10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on
the Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1
through 10.1.5, inclusive):

10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any
person of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of
privacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom,
due process of law, and individual conscience;

10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any
person of human rights;

10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive
any person of human rights, including not only the above-listed
rights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical
restraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from
torture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or
through lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from
self-incrimination;

10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals,
whether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by
any non-governmental person or entity;

10.1.5 censorship or '"filtering'" of any published information or expression.

10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any
Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by
any Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or
practice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human
rights of any persons.

10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including,
without limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to
use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it
(including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such
person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee
subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without
limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2,
inclusive.

11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to
Distribution of Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of
current export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or
any Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or
Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not
export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an
export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be
ancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium,
or by a method, customarily used for software interchange.

12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE
EXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply
with any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the
United States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or
transmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations
(including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is
identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of
some other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of
these countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software
directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of
their members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a
violation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the
current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You,
before exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should
be taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination. An Author other
than Hacktivismo may substitute that Author''s legal name for
'"Hacktivismo'" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released
by that Author under this Paragraph.

13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a
consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not
excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations
under this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then
as a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it
and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.

It is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the software distribution system reflected in this
License Agreement, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in
reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is
up to the Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that
choice.

14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity ('"Governmental
Entity'" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or
Governmental Person (as '"Governmental Person'" is defined broadly in
Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative
Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the
following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are
agreed to and fully met:

14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case
of any '"Governmental Person,'" if it is the position of that
Governmental Person''s Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or
doctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of
immunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this
License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against
such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such
Governmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change,
display, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any
Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof,
by the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that
Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to
inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to
render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully
enforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental
Person of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what
additional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully
enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the
required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use,
modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution,
shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all
reliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not
included or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure
to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is
irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written
notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the
Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use,
change, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of
the Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License
Agreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the
Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is
fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display,
performance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this
Paragraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided
herein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the
Governmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such
Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine
either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.

14.2 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or
distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any
Governmental Person who does so (whether that person''s Governmental
Entity contends the person''s action was, or was not, authorized or
official), permanently and irrevocably waives any defense based on
sovereign immunity, official immunity, the Act of State Doctrine, or
any other form of immunity, that might otherwise apply as a defense
to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of this
License Agreement.

14.2.1 With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in
a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the
waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1
and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental
Entity to constitute a '"case . . . in which the foreign state has
waived its immunity,'" within the scope of 28 U.S.C. � 1605(a)(1) of
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such
Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the
'"commercial activity'" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. � 1605(a)(2),
(3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the
United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts
of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to
have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from
actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.2 With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized
end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of
Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in a United States court against a
foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as
provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly
acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a '"case
. . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity,'" within the
scope of 28 U.S.C. � 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act of 1976 (as amended). . Each such Governmental Entity also
specifically agrees and concedes that the '"commercial activity'"
exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. � 1605(a)(2), (3) are also
applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United
States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any
country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have
voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions
in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.3 With respect to any action or effort by the Author in the
United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental
Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such
Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided
in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by
each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which '"the
foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of
execution or from execution,'" in accordance with 28 U.S.C. �
1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as
amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and
concedes that the '"commercial activity'" exceptions to the FSIA, 28
U.S.C. � 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With respect to an
action brought against the United States or any United States
Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the
U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily
agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the
courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.4 With respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized
end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with
Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in the United States to execute a
judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or
executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity,
the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs
14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such
Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which '"the foreign state
has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from
execution,'" in accordance with 28 U.S.C. � 1610(a)(1) of the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental
Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the '"commercial
activity'" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. � 1610(a)(2), (d) are
also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United
States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any
country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have
voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions
in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.3 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies,
displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof,
or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person''s
Governmental Entity contends the person''s action was, or was not,
authorized or official), and thereby violates any terms and conditions
of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or Paragraph 10 (use
restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not only to
an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement
and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys''
fees, additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided
by law), but such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be
subject to a suit for money damages and injunctive relief by any
person whose human rights have been violated or infringed, in
violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any
Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings
an action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity
must notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author
the opportunity to intervene to assert the Author''s own
rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the
severity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement
or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference
to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they
are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of
this License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
License Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a
third-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental
Person, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person
conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive
damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the
extend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of
such person or entity''s status as a Governmental Person or
Governmental Entity.

14.4 Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental
Entity thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Software of any part thereof, or any of
whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person''s Governmental
Entity contends the person''s action was, or was not, authorized or
official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any
legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy
infringement of the Author''s copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the
third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any
immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States
Constitution or any other immunity doctrine (such as sovereign
immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity) that may apply to
state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.

14.5 Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State
of the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs,
displays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of
whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person''s Governmental
Entity contends the person''s action was, or was not, authorized or
official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any
legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy
infringement of the Author''s copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the
third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine
(such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme
Court decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies
solely to prospective injunctive relief. Also explicitly and
irrevocably waived is any underlying immunity doctrine that would
require the recognition of such a limited exception for purposes of
remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and persons
shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory
damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages,
costs and fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on
account of governmental status.

14.6 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies,
displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof,
or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person''s
Governmental Entity contends the person''s action was, or was not,
authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for
purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement,
(ii) to remedy infringement of the Author''s copyright, or (iii) to
invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section
14.3 any and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign
immunity, international comity, or any other doctrine of immunity
whether such doctrine is recognized in that government''s own courts,
or in the courts of any other government or nation.

14.6.1 Consistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this
waiver shall explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only
against suit, but also against execution against property, for
purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as
amended). All United States Governmental Entities shall be understood
to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against (i) suit
in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property
of the United States located within the territory of other countries.

14.7 Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement
(whether that person''s Governmental Entity contends the person''s
action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (ii) who are
personally involved in any activity, policy or practice of a
governmental entity that violates this License Agreement (whether that
person''s Governmental Entity contends the person''s action was, or was
not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify,
perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when
their Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a
Qualified Licensee, or has violated the terms of this License
Agreement, each and all individually waive and shall not be permitted
to assert any defense of official immunity, '"good faith'" immunity,
qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based on his
or her governmental status.

14.8 No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may,
by legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental
Entity, subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement,
if the Governmental Entity or any such person has voluntarily used,
modified, copied, displayed, performed, or distributed the Software or
any part thereof.

14.9 Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using,
modifying, changing, displaying, performing or distributing any
Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity
hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents, for purposes of (i) any
action to enforce the terms of this License Agreement, and (ii) any
action to enforce the Author''s copyright (whether such suit be for
injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court
or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction
of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms
of this License Agreement are believed by the Author to be
enforceable. Each such Governmental Entity hereby waives all
objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on
international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum
non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental
status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of
some other sovereign.

14.9.1 The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than
the United States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a
waiver for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976
(see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4, inclusive, supra), and all United
States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a
waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect to actions brought
in the courts of other sovereigns.

14.9.2 Forum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental
Entities that are not United States Governmental Entities shall be
subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia. The Author or an
authorized end-user may bring an action in another court in another
country, but the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such
an action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of
a third-party claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs
14.3 and 14.10), such a suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or
Person may be brought in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, or the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, as a direct substitute for the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for all
purposes of this Subparagraph.

14.9.3 Forum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States
Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be
subject to suit, in the following (non-exclusive) list of fora:
Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and Paris, France. The Author or an
authorized end-user may bring action in another court that can
exercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations shall
always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized
end-user) as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States
or a governmental subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph
14.10, any and all United States Governmental Persons shall be subject
to suit wherever applicable rules of personal jurisdiction and venue
shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such United States
Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non
conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular
lawful venue.

14.10 Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using,
copying, modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing
the Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental
Entity, or Governmental Person hereby voluntarily and irrevocably
consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to remedy human
rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as
reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or
tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of
a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the
third-party beneficiary reasonably believes the relevant terms of this
License Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental Entity or Person
hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections
based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of
forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or
governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in
the courts of some other sovereign.

14.10.1 Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively
valid and preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3
shall also apply for purposes of Subparagraph 14.10. All Governmental
Entities are subject to the same Waiver of Immunity as set forth in
Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.

15. Subsequent Versions of HESSLA. Hacktivismo may publish revised
and/or new versions of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software
License Agreement from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Any Program
released by Hacktivismo under a version of this License Agreement
prior to Version 1.0, shall be considered released under Version 1.0
of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, once
Version 1.0 is formally released. Prior to Version 1.0, any Software
released by Hacktivismo or a Licensee of Hacktivismo under a
lower-numbered version of the HESSLA shall be considered automatically
to be subject to a higher-number version of the HESSLA, whenever a
later-numbered version has been released.

Concerning the work of any other Author, if the Program specifies a
version number of this License Agreement which applies to it and '"any
later version,'" You have the option of following the terms and

Agreement then published by Hacktivismo. If the Program released by
another Author, specifies only a version number, then that version
number only shall apply. If '"the latest version,'" is specified, then
the latest version of the HESSLA published on the Hacktivismo Website
shall always apply at all times.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 1\. DEFINITIONS '"Contribution'" means: a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution '"originates'" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor''s behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works. '"Contributor'" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program. '"Licensed Patents'" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. '"Program'" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement. '"Recipient'" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors. '"Derivative Works'" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. '"Modified Works'" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof. '"Distribute'" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy. '"Source Code'" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files. '"Secondary License'" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor. 2\. GRANT OF RIGHTS a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works. b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient''s receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3). 3\. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then: a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3. 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code: a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability ('"notices'") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices. 4\. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ('"Commercial Contributor'") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ('"Indemnified Contributor'") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively '"Losses'") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor''s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5\. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6\. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient''s patent(s), then such Recipient''s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient''s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient''s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice '"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.'" Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership. "

Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Work: Licensed under the EUPL or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL. 1.Definitions In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: — ‘The Licence’:this Licence. — ‘The Original Work’:the work or software distributed or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. — ‘Derivative Works’:the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. — ‘The Work’:the Original Work or its Derivative Works. — ‘The Source Code’:the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify. — ‘The Executable Code’:any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. — ‘The Licensor’:the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates the Work under the Licence. — ‘Contributor(s)’:any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. — ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’:any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Work under the terms of the Licence. — ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’:any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. 2.Scope of the rights granted by the Licence The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: — use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, — reproduce the Work, — modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, — communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, — distribute the Work or copies thereof, — lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, — sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof. Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed. The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence. 3.Communication of the Source Code The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work. 4.Limitations on copyright Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto. 5.Obligations of the Licensee The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee''s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work. Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. 6.Chain of Authorship The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence. 7.Disclaimer of Warranty The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development. For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work. 8.Disclaimer of Liability Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 9.Additional agreements While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability. 10.Acceptance of the Licence The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions. Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof. 11.Information to the public In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee. 12.Termination of the Licence The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence. 13.Miscellaneous Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work. If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value.

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled '"LEGAL'" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 6. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases '"FreeImage'", `FreeImage Public License'", '"FIPL'", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item,'" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation,'" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis. EXHIBIT A.

As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient''s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 3\. REQUIREMENTS A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in source code form: a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4\. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ('"Commercial Contributor'") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ('"Indemnified Contributor'") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively '"Losses'") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor''s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 5\. NO WARRANTY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 6\. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. GENERAL If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient''s patent(s), then such Recipient''s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. All Recipient''s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient''s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient''s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party''s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled '"LEGAL'" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs If Contributor''s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor''s Modifications are Contributor''s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5\. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6\. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions Netscape Communications Corporation ('"Netscape'") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases '"Mozilla'", '"MOZILLAPL'", '"MOZPL'", '"Netscape'", '"MPL'", '"NPL'" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8\. Termination 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as '"Participant'") alleging that: such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant''s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10\. U.S. government end users The Covered Code is a '"commercial item,'" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of '"commercial computer software'" and '"commercial computer software documentation,'" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 11\. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 12\. Responsibility for claims As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 13\. Multiple-licensed code Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as '"Multiple- Licensed'". '"Multiple-Licensed'" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following: a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work; b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ('"Derivative Works'") based upon the Original Work; c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Upstream Compatibility License and all Derivative Work You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under both this Upstream Compatibility License and the Apache License 2.0 or later; d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and e) to display the Original Work publicly. 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works. 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term '"Source Code'" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine- readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work. 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor''s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 5) External Deployment. The term '"External Deployment'" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c). 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an '"Attribution Notice.'" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an '"AS IS'" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer. 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. 9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including '"fair use'" or '"fair dealing'"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c). 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware. 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 12) Attorneys'' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 14) Definition of '"You'" in This License. '"You'" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, '"You'" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, '"control'" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen and Copyright © 2017 Nigel Tzeng. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the '"Modified License'") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the '"Open Software License'" or '"OSL'" or the '"Upstream Compatibility License'" or '"UCL'" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice '"Licensed under '" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process."

License Grants and Conditions 2.1. Grants Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version. 2.2. Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4. Subsequent Licenses No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 2.5. Representation Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 2.6. Fair Use This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents. 2.7. Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. 3\. Responsibilities 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5\. Termination 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non- compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. 6\. Disclaimer of Warranty Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non- infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. 7\. Limitation of Liability Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 8\. Litigation Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter- claims. 9\. Miscellaneous This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor. 10\. Versions of the License 10.1. New Versions Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 10.2. Effect of New Versions You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward. 10.3. Modified Versions If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License). 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice. You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership. Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. "

('"Licensor'"). Any BitTorrent Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product. Preamble This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the '"JOSL'"), which has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from the JOSL have been deleted. This License provides that: 1\. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required. 2\. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms '"Licensed Product,'" '"Modifications,'" '"Contributors'" and '"Source Code'" are defined in the License.) 3\. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term '"Derivative Works'" is defined in the License.) 4\. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others free of charge and without a royalty. 5\. You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such executable versions contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications, you may not sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn''t work properly or causes you any injury or damages. 6\. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for, sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code. 7\. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate. You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product. Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI- approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications. New versions of this License may be published from time to time in connection with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed hereunder, however, the new versions of this License will at all times apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor after the release of the new version of this License. Only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License. License Terms 1\. Grant of License From Licensor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non- exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by a Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works. b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 2\. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. '"Modifications'" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term '"Licensed Product'" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a '"Contributor'") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following: a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works. b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 3\. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or display any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor in any domain name, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to you in any manner or in any media. 4\. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution. a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(d). b. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, without charge, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an '"Electronic Distribution Mechanism'"). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for as long as any executable or other form of the Licensed Product is distributed by you. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. c. Intellectual Property Matters. i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party''s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled '"LEGAL'" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained. ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface ('"API'") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(c)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. d. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients'' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the '"Notice'") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer. e. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer. f. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto. g. Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of Licensed Products, Modifications or Derivative Works. Notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, by distributing, selling, licensing, sublicensing or otherwise making available any Licensed Product, or Modification or Derivative Work thereof, you and Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree that you may sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any other Contributor, provided that such executable versions (i) contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise material Derivative Works. For purposes of this License, an executable version of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, if (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third party?s software programs or other code, and/or the Licensed Product is combined with a number of your own or a third party?s software programs or code, respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or contribute material value, functionality or features to the License Product. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another Contributor?s material Modifications or is otherwise not a material Derivative Work, in each case as contemplated herein, you may not sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable. Additionally, without limitation of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of this License to the contrary, you cannot charge for, sell, license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code. 5\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it. 6\. Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference. 7\. Versions of This License. a. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License. b. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version, provided that any such license be in full force and effect at the time, and has not been revoked or otherwise terminated. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version (but not any prior version) of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License. c. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor. 8\. Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 9\. Termination. a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days of being notified of the breach by the Licensor. For purposes of this provision, proof of delivery via email to the address listed in the ?WHOIS? database of the registrar for any website through which you distribute or market any Licensed Product, or to any alternate email address which you designate in writing to the Licensor, shall constitute sufficient notification. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they continue to complye with the terms of this License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the '"Notice Period'") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period. c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 10\. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 11\. Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 12\. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein. 13\. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that in any litigation relating to this license the losing party shall be responsible for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 14\. Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, is under common control with, or affiliated with, you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

License Grants and Conditions -------------------------------- 2.1. Grants Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license: (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version. 2.2. Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party''s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4. Subsequent Licenses No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 2.5. Representation Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License. 2.6. Fair Use This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents. 2.7. Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. 3. Responsibilities ------------------- 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients'' rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation --------------------------------------------------- If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Termination -------------- 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. ************************************************************************ * * * 6.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ('"LICENSE'"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT''S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE. License Background Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License. This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License. The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program. 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program. 1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program. 1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter. 1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License. 1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. 1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions. 1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program. 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor. 2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor. 2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License. 3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS 3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and b. its license agreement: i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; iii. states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner. 3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form: a. it must be made available under this License; and b. a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program. 3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself. 3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained. 3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS 4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program. 5. NO WARRANTY 5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 5.2 Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 5.3 Each Recipient acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING 7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA (collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Program. 7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other attribution notices remain in the Program. 8. PATENT LITIGATION 8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 9. OWNERSHIP 9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 10. TERMINATION 10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination. 11. GENERAL 11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License. 11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties contractantes confirment qu''elles ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en anglais. 11.6 The Program is subject to all export and import laws, restrictions and regulations of the country in which Recipient receives the Program. Recipient is solely responsible for complying with and ensuring that Recipient does not export, re-export, or import the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or without any necessary licenses and authorizations. 11.7 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof."

*This Cryptographic Autonomy License (the '"License'") applies to any
Work whose owner has marked it with any of the following notices, or a
similar demonstration of intent:*

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Purpose

This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the
software to which it applies (the '"Work'"), either as-is or in modified
form, for Your private purposes, while protecting the owners and
contributors to the software from liability.

This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third
parties who receive the Work from you. If any non-affiliated third
party receives any part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this
License requires that You provide that third party all the permissions
and materials needed to independently use and modify the Work without
that third party having a loss of data or capability due to your
actions.

The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

## 2. Receiving a License

In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The
rules of this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the
Licensor and conditions to your License. You must not do anything with
the Work that triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow.

### 2.1. Application

The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from
Licensor, as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or
implementations created by You that contain any licensable portion of
the Work (a '"Modified Work'"). Unless specified, any reference to the
Work also applies to a Modified Work.

### 2.2. Offer and Acceptance

This License is automatically offered to every person and
organization. You show that you accept this License and agree to its
conditions by taking any action with the Work that, absent this
License, would infringe any intellectual property right held by
Licensor.

### 2.3. Compliance and Remedies

Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this
License places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License
and infringes the intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the
event of infringement, the terms and conditions of this License may be
enforced by Licensor under the intellectual property laws of any
jurisdiction to which You are subject. You also agree that either the
Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party beneficiary) may
enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You via
specific performance.

## 3. Permissions
### 3.1. Permissions Granted

Conditioned on compliance with section 4, and subject to the
limitations of section 3.2, Licensor grants You the world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive permission to:

+ a) Take any action with the Work that would infringe the non-patent
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are
subject; and

+ b) claims that Licensor can license or becomes able to
license, to the extent that those claims are embodied in the Work as
distributed by Licensor. ### 3.2. Limitations on Permissions Granted

The following limitations apply to the permissions granted in section
3.1:

+ a) Licensor does not grant any patent license for claims that are
only infringed due to modification of the Work as provided by
Licensor, or the combination of the Work as provided by Licensor,
directly or indirectly, with any other component, including other
software or hardware.

+ b) Licensor does not grant any license to the trademarks, service
marks, or logos of Licensor, except to the extent necessary to comply
with the attribution conditions in section 4.1 of this License.

## 4. Conditions

If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the
Work, or any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed,
communicated, made available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate
third party (a '"Recipient'"), either via physical delivery or via a
network connection to the Recipient, You must comply with the
following conditions:

### 4.1. Provide Access to Source Code

Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each
Recipient a copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the
Source Code corresponding to the Work ('"Access'").

The '"Source Code'" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for
making modifications, including any comments, configuration
information, documentation, help materials, installation instructions,
cryptographic seeds or keys, and any information reasonably necessary
for the Recipient to independently compile and use the Source Code and
to have full access to the functionality contained in the Work.

#### 4.1.1. Providing Network Access to the Source Code

Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You
or by a third party, such as a public software repository, and must
persist during the same period in which You exercise any of the
permissions granted to You under this License and for at least one
year thereafter.

#### 4.1.2. Source Code for a Modified Work

Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each
Recipient of a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to
those portions of the Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as
the modifications used by You to create the Modified Work. The Source
Code corresponding to the modifications in the Modified Work must be
provided to the Recipient either a) under this License, or b) under a
Compatible Open Source License.

A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be
distributed together as a single work.

#### 4.1.3. Coordinated Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities

You may delay providing the Source Code corresponding to a particular
modification of the Work for up to ninety (90) days (the '"Embargo
Period'") if:

+ a) the modification is intended to address a newly-identified
vulnerability or a security flaw in the Work,

+ b) disclosure of the vulnerability or security flaw before the end
of the Embargo Period would put the data, identity, or autonomy of one
or more Recipients of the Work at significant risk,

+ c) You are participating in a coordinated disclosure of the
vulnerability or security flaw with one or more additional Licensees,
and

+ d) Access to the Source Code pertaining to the modification is
provided to all Recipients at the end of the Embargo Period.

### 4.2. Maintain User Autonomy

In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access
to the Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this
License to interfere with a Recipient''s ability to fully use an
independent copy of the Work generated from the Source Code You
provide with the Recipient''s own User Data.

'"User Data'" means any data that is an input to or an output from the
Work, where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially
identical use of the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the
Recipient, and where the Recipient has an existing ownership interest,
an existing right to possess, or where the data has been generated by,
for, or has been assigned to the Recipient.

#### 4.2.1. No Withholding User Data

Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions
granted to You under this License, You must also provide to any
Recipient to whom you provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy,
provided in a commonly used electronic form, of the Recipient''s User
Data in your possession, to the extent that such User Data is
available to You for use in conjunction with the Work.

#### 4.2.2. No Technical Measures that Limit Access

You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to
anything provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of
cryptographic keys, seeds, hashes, by any other technological
protection measures, or by any other method, limit a Recipient''s
ability to access any functionality present in Recipient''s independent
copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control of the
Recipient''s User Data.

#### 4.2.3. No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access

You may not contractually restrict a Recipient''s ability to
independently exercise the permissions granted under this License. You
waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technical protection
measures that include use of the Work, and You waive any claim that
the capabilities of the Work were limited or modified as a means of
enforcing the legal rights of third parties against Recipients.

### 4.3. Provide Notices and Attribution

You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices
contained in the Source Code (the '"Notices'"), and provide all such
Notices to each Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the
use of the Work. Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or
via an easy-to-find hyperlink to an Internet location also providing
Access to Source Code.

### 4.4. Scope of Conditions in this License

You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only
relative to those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than
providing Recipients with the applicable Notices, Access to Source
Code, and a copy of and full control of their User Data, nothing in
this License requires You to provide processing services to or engage
in network interactions with anyone.

### 4.5. Combined Work Exception

As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to
Source Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having
the '"Combined Work Exception,'" or any object code exclusively
resulting from Source Code files so marked, may be combined with other
Software into a '"Larger Work.'" So long as you comply with the
requirements to provide Recipients the applicable Notices and Access
to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you provide
Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient''s
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software
in the Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be
licensed under the terms of your choice.

## 5. Term and Termination

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and
continues until terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or
until all Licensor''s intellectual property rights in the Software
expire, whichever comes first ('"Term'"). This License cannot be
revoked, only terminated for the reasons listed below.

### 5.1. Effect of Termination

If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted
to You under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You
will immediately cease exercising any permissions granted in this
License relative to the Work, including as part of any Modified Work.

### 5.2. Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement

This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any
of the conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination
for non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License
will automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all
the conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified
by Licensor or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your
noncompliance. You are eligible for reinstatement of permissions for
the Work one time only, and only for the sixty days immediately after
becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of permissions granted for the
Work under this License due to either a) sustained noncompliance
lasting more than sixty days or b) subsequent termination for
noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless rights are
specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

### 5.3. Termination Due to Litigation

If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the
Work, either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You
by this License shall terminate. In the event of termination due to
litigation, all permissions validly granted by You under this License,
directly or indirectly, shall survive termination. Administrative
review procedures, declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims in
response to patent litigation, and enforcement actions against former
Licensees terminated under this section do not cause termination due
to litigation.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limit on Liability

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty
of any kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone
for any damages related to this software or this license, under any
kind of legal claim, or for any type of damages, including indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any type arising as a
result of this License or the use of the Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, loss of profits, revenue, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses.

## 7. Other Provisions
### 7.1. Affiliates

An '"Affiliate'" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and
natural persons acting as contractors exclusively providing services
to Licensee are also Affiliates.

### 7.2. Choice of Jurisdiction and Governing Law

A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating
to a Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only
in the courts of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a
particular jurisdiction (excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if
Licensor provides conspicuous notice of the particular jurisdiction to
all Licensees.

### 7.3. No Sublicensing

This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a
license under the terms described in this License. You may not impose
any further reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any
Recipients'' exercise of the permissions granted herein.

### 7.4. Attorneys'' Fees

In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'' fees
and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. A '"prevailing party'" is the party that
achieves, or avoids, compliance with this License, including through
settlement. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

### 7.5. No Waiver

Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will
not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit
Licensor''s ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

### 7.6. Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted
to the effect and intent of the original portion. If such a
construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion
will be severed from this License but the rest of this License will
remain in full force and effect.

Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, with the caveat that
any modifications of this license may not use the name '"Cryptographic
Autonomy License'" or any name confusingly similar thereto to describe

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE, COPY, MODIFY, NOR (RE)DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE, NOR ANY PART(S) THEREOF. I. Definitions 1. '"This Product'" means the work (including, but not limited to, source code, graphics, texts, and accompanying files) made available under and governed by this version of this license ('"License'"), as may be indicated by, but is not limited to, copyright notice(s) attached to or included in the work. 2. '"You'" means (and '"Your'" refers to) an individual or a legal entity (e.g., a non-profit organization, commercial organization, government agency, etc.) exercising permissions granted by this License. 3. '"Modification'" means (and '"modify'" refers to) any alteration of This Product, including, but not limited to, addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of This Product, translation into another language, repackaging, alteration or removal of any file included with This Product, and addition of any new files to This Product. 4. '"Your Product'" means This Product modified by You, or any work You derive from (or base on) any part of This Product. In addition, '"Your Product'" means any work in which You include any (modified or unmodified) portion of This Product. However, if the work in which you include it is an aggregate software distribution (such as an operating system distribution or a cover CD-ROM of a magazine) containing multiple separate products, then the term '"Your Product'" includes only those products (in the aggregate software distribution) that use, include, or depend on a modified or unmodified version of This Product (and the term '"Your Product'" does not include the whole aggregate software distribution). For the purposes of this License, a product suite consisting of two or more products is considered a single product (operating system distributions and cover media of magazines are not considered product suites). 5. '"Distribution'" means (and '"distribute'" refers to), regardless of means or methods, conveyance, transfer, providing, or making available of This/Your Product or portions thereof to third parties (including, but not limited to, making This/Your Product, or portions thereof, available for download to third parties, whether or not any third party has downloaded the product, or any portion thereof, made available for download).

Your Product (and any associated materials, e.g., the documentation, the content of the official web site of Your Product, etc.) must not present any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt.org (or any domain name that forwards to the domain name truecrypt.org) in a manner that might suggest that it is where information about Your Product may be obtained or where bugs found in Your Product may be reported or where support for Your Product may be available or otherwise attempt to indicate that the domain name truecrypt.org is associated with Your Product. d. The complete source code of Your Product must be freely and publicly available (for exceptions, see Section III.2) at least until You cease to distribute Your Product. This condition can be met in one or both of the following ways: (i) You include the complete source code of Your Product with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and You make all such copies of Your Product available to the general public free of charge, and/or (ii) You include information (valid and correct at least until You cease to distribute Your Product) about where the complete source code of Your Product can be obtained free of charge (e.g., an Internet address) or for a reasonable reproduction fee with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute and, if there is a web site officially associated with Your Product, You include the aforementioned information about the source code on a freely and publicly accessible web page to which such web site links via an easily viewable hyperlink (at least until You cease to distribute Your Product). The source code of Your Product must not be deliberately obfuscated and it must not be in an intermediate form (e.g., the output of a preprocessor). Source code means the preferred form in which a programmer would usually modify the program. Portions of the source code of Your Product not contained in This Product (e.g., portions added by You in creating Your Product, whether created by You or by third parties) must be available under license(s) that (however, see also Subsection III.1.e) allow(s) anyone to modify and derive new works from the portions of the source code that are not contained in This Product and to use, copy, and redistribute such modifications and/or derivative works. The license(s) must be perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, and worldwide, and must not invalidate, weaken, restrict, interpret, amend, modify, interfere with or otherwise affect any part, term, provision, or clause of this License. The text(s) of the license(s) must be included with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute. e. You must not change the license terms of This Product in any way (adding any new terms is considered changing the license terms even if the original terms are retained), which means, e.g., that no part of This Product may be put under another license. You must keep intact all the legal notices contained in the source code files. You must include the following items with every copy of Your Product that You make and distribute: a clear and conspicuous notice stating that Your Product or portion(s) thereof is/are governed by this version of the TrueCrypt License, a verbatim copy of this version of the TrueCrypt License (as contained herein), a clear and conspicuous notice containing information about where the included copy of the License can be found, and an appropriate copyright notice. 2.

The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non- exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'''') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 3\. Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'''' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients'' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5\. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 6\. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'''') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'''', ``MOZILLAPL'''', ``MOZPL'''', ``Netscape'''', ``NPL'''' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'''' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8\. TERMINATION. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY''S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 10\. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'''' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'''' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'''' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. . \----------------------------------------------------------- Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute these programs and their documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,provided that the below copyright notice and historical background appear in all copies and that both the copyright notice and historical background and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that the names of MIT, HIS, BULL or BULL HN not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the programs without specific prior written permission.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don''t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'' usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits'') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text: '"'"'" Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. '"'"'" Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms =========== 0. Definitions -------------- Throughout this license, the terms `package'', `FreeType Project'', and `FreeType archive'' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project'', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. `You'' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using'' is a generic term including compiling the project''s source code as well as linking it to form a `program'' or `executable''. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine''. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this. The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below. 1. No Warranty -------------- THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. 2. Redistribution ----------------- This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions: o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT'') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files. o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn''t mandatory. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3. Advertising -------------- Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project'', `FreeType Engine'', `FreeType library'', or `FreeType Distribution''. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. 4. Contacts ----------- There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: o freetype@nongnu.org Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven''t found anything to help you in the documentation. o freetype-devel@nongnu.org Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc. Our home page can be found at http://www.freetype.org --- end of FTL.TXT ---"

À PROPOS DE CETTE LICENCE

La présente licence a vocation à être utilisée par les administrations pour la
réutilisation de leurs informations publiques. Elle peut également être utilisée par
toute personne souhaitant mettre à disposition de l’ « Information » dans les
conditions définies par la présente licence

La France est dotée d’un cadre juridique global visant à une diffusion spontanée par
les administrations de leurs informations publiques afin d’en permettre la plus large
réutilisation.
Le droit de la « Réutilisation » de l’ « Information » des administrations est régi par le
code des relations entre le public et l’administration (CRPA).
Cette licence facilite la réutilisation libre et gratuite des informations publiques et
figure parmi les licences qui peuvent être utilisées par l’administration en vertu du
décret pris en application de l’article L.323-2 du CRPA.

Etalab est la mission chargée, sous l’autorité du Premier ministre, d’ouvrir le plus
grand nombre de données publiques des administrations de l’Etat et de ses
établissements publics. Elle a réalisé la Licence Ouverte pour faciliter la réutilisation
libre et gratuite de ces informations publiques, telles que définies par l’article L321-1
du CRPA.
Cette licence est la version 2.0 de la Licence Ouverte.

Etalab se réserve la faculté de proposer de nouvelles versions de la Licence Ouverte.
Cependant, les « Réutilisateurs » pourront continuer à réutiliser les informations qu’ils
ont obtenues sous cette licence s’ils le souhaitent. "

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty- free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Sybase''s Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following: 2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance: (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and (b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6. (c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance by clicking on an '"I accept'" button or similar mechanism. If a click-wrap format is not included, you must include a statement that any use (including without limitation reproduction, modification or distribution) of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes acceptance of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms and conditions of the License. 2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance: (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; (c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); (d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code; and (e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains terms no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms of this License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this License are offered by You alone and not by any other party. 2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code. 3\. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Sybase''s licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2. 4\. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. 5\. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion. 6\. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with this License ('"Additional Terms'") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient''s agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. 7\. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version.

Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase ('"Sybase Modifications'"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all. 12\. Termination. 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: (a) automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as a cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor. 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control.

No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party. 13\. Miscellaneous. 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a '"commercial item'" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among you, Sybase or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase''s or any Contributor''s right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute. 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License. 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control. 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exig¨¨ que le pr¨¨sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r¨¨di¨¨s en anglais. EXHIBIT A. '"Portions Copyright (c) 1983-2002 Sybase, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Definitions: '"Package'" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. '"Standard Version'" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. '"Copyright Holder'" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. '"You'" is you, if you''re thinking about copying or distributing this Package. '"Reasonable copying fee'" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 4\. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 5\. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. 6\.

Public License, Version 1.0 (YPL) This Yahoo! Public License (this '"Agreement'") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089 ('"Yahoo!'") will provide software to you via download or otherwise ('"Software'"). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity ('"You'") agree to the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows: 1. Grant of Copyright License * 1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a '"Modification;'" however, any file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a '"Modification.'" * 1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement. * 1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You '"stand in the shoes'" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You '"stand in the shoes'" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California. * 1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3. * 1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose. 2. Support * Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the Software. 3. Intellectual Property Rights * 3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved. * 3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the Software. * 3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party''s name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2. 4. Disclaimer of Warranties * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED '"AS IS'" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING. 5. Limitation of Liability * IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 6. Term and Termination * 6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6. * 6.2 - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this Agreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement. * 6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement. * 6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting Yahoo!''s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this Agreement. 7. Miscellaneous * This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement involving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party''s rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such party''s rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party''s right to take subsequent action."

Stephenson (Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman) Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs. The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement. Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights. Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed. Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack. COPYING POLICIES 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the following: a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option) c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.) For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable. 4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. Stated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don''t try to stop anyone else from sharing it farther."

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. **Preamble** This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software. You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement. **Definitions** '"Copyright Holder'" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package. '"Contributor'" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder''s procedures. '"You'" and '"your'" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package. '"Package'" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version. '"Distribute'" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization. '"Distributor Fee'" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees. '"Standard Version'" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder. '"Modified Version'" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder. '"Original License'" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future. '"Source'" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package. '"Compiled'" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form. **Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution** (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version. **Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version** (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package. (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License. **Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source** (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version. (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under (i) the Original License or (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed. **Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source** (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license. (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version. **Aggregating or Linking the Package** (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation. (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package. **Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version** (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license. **General Provisions** (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license. (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license. (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder. (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed. (14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS '"AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own. Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its colloquial name \'"BSD New\'", this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the \'"Simplified BSD License\'". On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final \'"no-endorsement\'" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License. Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of any product using that code. It was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that clause 3 is \'"hereby deleted in its entirety.\'" The four clause license has not been approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the advertising clause. This prelude is not part of the license.

THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1. Definitions a. '"Collective Work'" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. b. '"Derivative Work'" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. c. '"Licensor'" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License. d. '"Original Author'" means the individual or entity who created the Work. e. '"Work'" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. f.

'"License Elements'" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike. 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f). 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.

You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. d. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ('"cover version'") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 5.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor''s knowledge after reasonable inquiry: i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments; ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party. b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark '"Creative Commons'" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

Section 1 – Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter''s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License. d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike. h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. i.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. n.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. A.

Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply. C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes. Section 3 – License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. b. ShareAlike. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply. 1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License. 2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter''s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. 3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter''s License You apply. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority."

Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in Section 4(e). 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ('"Applicable License'"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License. c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works. d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ('"Attribution Parties'") in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c). f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.

Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products. For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people. For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software. For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim. As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved. If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees). Definitions: * '"Package'" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. * '"Standard Version'" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. * '"Copyright Holder'" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. '"You'" is you, if you''re thinking about copying or distributing this Package. * '"Reasonable copying fee'" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) * '"Freely Available'" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. * 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following: rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following: accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. 7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package. 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 9.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 7\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 8\. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 10\. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability."

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked '"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,'" or a modification could indicate '"The original work has been modified.'"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the '"Applicable License'"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License. c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ('"Attribution Parties'") in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark '"Creative Commons'" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes. Section 3 – License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share Adapted Material; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority."

All Rights Reserved. Note: This license is derived from the '"Artistic License'" as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from those of the '"Artistic License.'" PREAMBLE The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications. Definitions: '"Package'" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification. '"Standard Version'" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder. '"Copyright Holder'" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. '"You'" is you, if you''re thinking about copying or distributing this Package. '"Reasonable copying fee'" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) '"Freely Available'" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package. b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following: a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications. c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. 7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language. 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. 9.

Distribution Obligations. 3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party''s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled '"../LEGAL'''' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor''s Modifications include an application programming interface ('"API'"../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor''s Modifications are Contributor''s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License . 3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient''s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5\. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 6\. Versions of the License. 6.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. ('"Sun'") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that the phrases '"Sun,'" '"Sun Public License,'" or '"SPL'"../ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 7\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN '"../AS IS'''' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 8\. TERMINATION. 8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as '"Participant'") alleging that: (a) such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant''s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant''s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

Data is provided to You under this Agreement by each of the Data Providers. Your exercise of any of the rights and permissions granted below constitutes Your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The benefits that each Data Provider receives from making Data available and that You receive from Data or otherwise under these terms and conditions shall be deemed sufficient consideration for the formation of this Agreement. Accordingly, Data Provider(s) and You (the “Parties”) agree as follows: Section 1. Definitions 1.1 “Add” means to supplement Data with Your own or someone else’s Data, resulting in Your “Additions.” Additions do not include Results. 1.2 “Computational Use” means Your analysis (through the use of computational devices or otherwise) or other interpretation of Data. By way of example and not limitation, “Computational Use” includes the application of any computational analytical technique, the purpose of which is the analysis of any Data in digital form to generate information about Data such as patterns, trends, correlations, inferences, insights and attributes. 1.3 “Data” means the information (including copyrightable information, such as images or text), collectively or individually, whether created or gathered by a Data Provider or an Entity acting on its behalf, to which rights are granted under this Agreement. 1.4 “Data Provider” means any Entity (including any employee or contractor of such Entity authorized to Publish Data on behalf of such Entity) that Publishes Data under this Agreement prior to Your Receiving it. 1.5 “Enhanced Data” means the subset of Data that You Publish and that is composed of (a) Your Additions and/or (b) Modifications to Data You have received under this Agreement. 1.6 “Entity” means any natural person or organization that exists under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, together with all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (a) the power, directly or indirectly, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (b) the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or securities, (c) the beneficial ownership of such entity or, (d) the ability to appoint, whether by agreement or right, the majority of directors of an Entity. 1.7 “Ledger” means a digital record of Data or grants of rights in Data governed by this Agreement, using any technology having functionality to record and store Data or grants, contributions, or licenses to Data governed by this Agreement. 1.8 “Modify” means to delete, erase, correct or re-arrange Data, resulting in “Modifications.” Modifications do not include Results. 1.9 “Publish” means to make all or a subset of Data (including Your Enhanced Data) available in any manner which enables its Use, including by providing a copy on physical media or remote access. For any form of Entity, that is to make the Data available to any individual who is not employed by that Entity or engaged as a contractor or agent to perform work on that Entity’s behalf. A “Publication” occurs each time You Publish Data. 1.10 “Receive” or “Receives” means to have been given access to Data, locally or remotely. 1.11 “Results” means the outcomes or outputs that You obtain from Your Computational Use of Data. Results shall not include more than a de minimis portion of the Data on which the Computational Use is based. 1.12 “Sui Generis Database Rights” means rights, other than copyright, resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 1.13 “Use” means using Data (including accessing, copying, studying, reviewing, adapting, analyzing, evaluating, or making Computational Use of it), either by machines or humans, or a combination of both. 1.14 “You” or “Your” means any Entity that Receives Data under this Agreement.

Notices that purport to modify this Agreement shall be of no effect. 3.4 You and each Data Provider agree that Enhanced Data shall not be considered a work of joint authorship by virtue of its relationship to Data licensed under this Agreement and shall not require either any obligation of accounting to or the consent of any Data Provider. 3.5 This Agreement imposes no obligations or restrictions on Your Use or Publication of Results. Section 4. Data Provider(s)’ Representations 4.1 Each Data Provider represents that the Data Provider has exercised reasonable care, to assure that: (a) the Data it Publishes was created or generated by it or was obtained from others with the right to Publish the Data under this Agreement; and (b) Publication of such Data does not violate any privacy or confidentiality obligation undertaken by the Data Provider. Section 5.

If Your rights under this Agreement terminate, You agree to cease Receipt, Use and Publication of Data. However, Your obligations and any rights and permissions granted by You under this Agreement relating to Data that You Published prior to such termination will continue and survive. 5.2 If You institute litigation against a Data Provider or anyone else who Receives the Data (including a cross-claim in a lawsuit) based on the Data, other than a claim asserting breach of this Agreement, then any rights previously granted to You to Receive, Use and Publish Data under this Agreement will terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Section 6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability 6.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE DATA (INCLUDING ENHANCED DATA) IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 6.2 NEITHER YOU NOR ANY DATA PROVIDERS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Miscellaneous 7.1 You agree that it is solely Your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws with regard to Your Use or Publication of Data, including any applicable privacy, data protection, security and export laws. You agree to take reasonable steps to assist a Data Provider fulfilling responsibilities to comply with applicable laws with regard to Use or Publication of Data Received hereunder. 7.2 You and Data Provider(s), collectively and individually, waive and/or agree not to assert, to the extent permitted by law, any moral rights You or they hold in Data. 7.3 This Agreement confers no rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than the Parties and their respective heirs, executors, successors and assigns. 7.4 The Data Provider(s) reserve no right or expectation of privacy, data protection or confidentiality in any Data that they Publish under this Agreement. If You choose to Publish Data under this Agreement, You similarly do so with no reservation or expectation of any rights of privacy or confidentiality in that Data. 7.5 The Community Data License Agreement workgroup under The Linux Foundation is the steward of this Agreement (“Steward”). No one other than the Steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this Agreement. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. You may Use and Publish Data Received hereunder under the terms of the version of the Agreement under which You originally Received the Data, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the Steward."

'"Collection'" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and, b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d). 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ('"Attribution Parties'") in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. d. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b). e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor or reputation. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

'"Derivative Work'" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed- relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. c. '"Licensor'" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License. d. '"Original Author'" means the individual or entity who created the Work. e. '"Work'" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. f.

You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file- sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. d.

Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ('"cover version'") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 5\.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8\. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 5\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor''s knowledge after reasonable inquiry: i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments; ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party. b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN '"AS IS'" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK. 6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8\. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. **Section 1 – Definitions.** 1. **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. 2. **Adapter''s License** means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. 3. **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section [2(b)(1)-(2)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s2b) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. 4. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. 5. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. 6. **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. 7. **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. 8. **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. 9. **NonCommercial** means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange. 10. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. 11. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 12. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. **Your** has a corresponding meaning. **Section 2 – Scope.** 1. **License grant**. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and 2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s6a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section [2(a)(4)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s2a4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. 1. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. 2. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai). 2. **Other rights**. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes. **Section 3 – License Conditions.** Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. 1. **Attribution**. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: 1. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: 1. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); 2. a copyright notice; 3. a notice that refers to this Public License; 4. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; 5. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; 2. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and 3. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section [3(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s3a1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section [3(a)(1)(A)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter''s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. **Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.** Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: 1. for the avoidance of doubt, Section [2(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s2a1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; 2. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and 3. You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s3a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s4) supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. **Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.** 1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.** 2. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.** 1. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. **Section 6 – Term and Termination.** 1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. 2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s6a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s6b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. 3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. 4. Sections [1](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s1), [5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s5), [6](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s6), [7](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s7), and [8](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode#s8) survive termination of this Public License. **Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.** 1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. 2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. **Section 8 – Interpretation.** 1. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. 2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. 3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. 4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at [creativecommons.org/policies](http://creativecommons.org/policies), Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN '"AS-IS'" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ('"CCPL'" OR '"LICENSE'"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1. Definitions a. '"Collective Work'" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. b. '"Derivative Work'" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. c. '"Licensor'" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License. d. '"Original Author'" means the individual or entity who created the Work. e. '"Work'" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. f. '"You'" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e). 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ('"cover version'") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'").

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8\. Miscellaneous a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d.

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. '"Collection'" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole.

'"Licensor'" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e.

For example, a translation could be marked '"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,'" or a modification could indicate '"The original work has been modified.'"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d). 4\. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ('"Attribution Parties'") in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. d. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c). e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8\. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.

Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 5) This section intentionally omitted. 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an '"Attribution Notice.'"

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor''s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 12) Attorneys'' Fees.

'"You'" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, '"You'" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, '"control'" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (C) 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification.

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

'"Adaptation'" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('"synching'") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. '"Collection'" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. '"Distribute'" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. '"Licensor'" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. '"Original Author'" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. '"Work'" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked '"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,'" or a modification could indicate '"The original work has been modified.'"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4\. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ('"Attribution Parties'") in Licensor''s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., '"French translation of the Work by Original Author,'" or '"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author''s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6\. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7\. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8\. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law. Creative Commons Notice Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license.

Definitionen a. Der Begriff '"Abwandlung'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bezeichnet das Ergebnis jeglicher Art von Veränderung des Schutzgegenstandes, solange die eigenpersönlichen Züge des Schutzgegenstandes darin nicht verblassen und daran eigene Schutzrechte entstehen. Das kann insbesondere eine Bearbeitung, Umgestaltung, Änderung, Anpassung, Übersetzung oder Heranziehung des Schutzgegenstandes zur Vertonung von Laufbildern sein. Nicht als Abwandlung des Schutzgegenstandes gelten seine Aufnahme in eine Sammlung oder ein Sammelwerk und die freie Benutzung des Schutzgegenstandes. b. Der Begriff '"Sammelwerk'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz meint eine Zusammenstellung von literarischen, künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Inhalten, sofern diese Zusammenstellung aufgrund von Auswahl und Anordnung der darin enthaltenen selbständigen Elemente eine geistige Schöpfung darstellt, unabhängig davon, ob die Elemente systematisch oder methodisch angelegt und dadurch einzeln zugänglich sind oder nicht. c. '"Verbreiten'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, den Schutzgegenstand oder Abwandlungen im Original oder in Form von Vervielfältigungsstücken, mithin in körperlich fixierter Form der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten oder in Verkehr zu bringen. d. Der '"Lizenzgeber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist diejenige natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe, die den Schutzgegenstand unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz anbietet und insoweit als Rechteinhaberin auftritt. e. '"Rechteinhaber'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz ist der Urheber des Schutzgegenstandes oder jede andere natürliche oder juristische Person oder Gruppe von Personen, die am Schutzgegenstand ein Immaterialgüterrecht erlangt hat, welches die in Abschnitt 3 genannten Handlungen erfasst und bei dem eine Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten oder eine Weiterübertragung an Dritte möglich ist. f.

Das kann insbesondere eine persönliche geistige Schöpfung jeglicher Art, ein Werk der kleinen Münze, ein nachgelassenes Werk oder auch ein Lichtbild oder anderes Objekt eines verwandten Schutzrechts sein, unabhängig von der Art seiner Fixierung und unabhängig davon, auf welche Weise jeweils eine Wahrnehmung erfolgen kann, gleichviel ob in analoger oder digitaler Form. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, unterfallen auch sie dem Begriff '"Schutzgegenstand'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz. g. Mit '"Sie'" bzw. '"Ihnen'" ist die natürliche oder juristische Person gemeint, die in dieser Lizenz im Abschnitt 3 genannte Nutzungen des Schutzgegenstandes vornimmt und zuvor in Hinblick auf den Schutzgegenstand nicht gegen Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verstoßen oder aber die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis des Lizenzgebers erhalten hat, die durch diese Lizenz gewährten Nutzungsrechte trotz eines vorherigen Verstoßes auszuüben. h. Unter '"Öffentlich Zeigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz sind Veröffentlichungen und Präsentationen des Schutzgegenstandes zu verstehen, die für eine Mehrzahl von Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind und in unkörperlicher Form mittels öffentlicher Wiedergabe in Form von Vortrag, Aufführung, Vorführung, Darbietung, Sendung, Weitersendung, zeit- und ortsunabhängiger Zugänglichmachung oder in körperlicher Form mittels Ausstellung erfolgen, unabhängig von bestimmten Veranstaltungen und unabhängig von den zum Einsatz kommenden Techniken und Verfahren, einschließlich drahtgebundener oder drahtloser Mittel und Einstellen in das Internet. i. '"Vervielfältigen'" im Sinne dieser Lizenz bedeutet, mittels beliebiger Verfahren Vervielfältigungsstücke des Schutzgegenstandes herzustellen, insbesondere durch Ton- oder Bildaufzeichnungen, und umfasst auch den Vorgang, erstmals körperliche Fixierungen des Schutzgegenstandes sowie Vervielfältigungsstücke dieser Fixierungen anzufertigen, sowie die Übertragung des Schutzgegenstandes auf einen Bild- oder Tonträger oder auf ein anderes elektronisches Medium, gleichviel ob in digitaler oder analoger Form. 2. Schranken des Immaterialgüterrechts. Diese Lizenz ist in keiner Weise darauf gerichtet, Befugnisse zur Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes zu vermindern, zu beschränken oder zu vereiteln, die Ihnen aufgrund der Schranken des Urheberrechts oder anderer Rechtsnormen bereits ohne Weiteres zustehen oder sich aus dem Fehlen eines immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutzes ergeben. 3. Einräumung von Nutzungsrechten. Unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz räumt Ihnen der Lizenzgeber - unbeschadet unverzichtbarer Rechte und vorbehaltlich des Abschnitts 3.e) - das vergütungsfreie, räumlich und zeitlich (für die Dauer des Schutzrechts am Schutzgegenstand) unbeschränkte einfache Recht ein, den Schutzgegenstand auf die folgenden Arten und Weisen zu nutzen ('"unentgeltlich eingeräumtes einfaches Nutzungsrecht für jedermann'"): a. den Schutzgegenstand in beliebiger Form und Menge zu vervielfältigen, ihn in Sammelwerke zu integrieren und ihn als Teil solcher Sammelwerke zu vervielfältigen; b. Abwandlungen des Schutzgegenstandes anzufertigen, einschließlich Übersetzungen unter Nutzung jedweder Medien, sofern deutlich erkennbar gemacht wird, dass es sich um Abwandlungen handelt; c. den Schutzgegenstand, allein oder in Sammelwerke aufgenommen, öffentlich zu zeigen und zu verbreiten; d.

Vergütung in sonstigen Fällen: Bezüglich lizenzgerechter Nutzung des Schutzgegenstandes durch Sie, die nicht unter die beiden vorherigen Abschnitte (i) und (ii) fällt, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf jegliche Vergütung, unabhängig davon, ob eine Einziehung der Vergütung durch ihn selbst oder nur durch eine Verwertungsgesellschaft möglich wäre. Das vorgenannte Nutzungsrecht wird für alle bekannten sowie für alle noch nicht bekannten Nutzungsarten eingeräumt. Es beinhaltet auch das Recht, solche Änderungen am Schutzgegenstand vorzunehmen, die für bestimmte nach dieser Lizenz zulässige Nutzungen technisch erforderlich sind. Alle sonstigen Rechte, die über diesen Abschnitt hinaus nicht ausdrücklich durch den Lizenzgeber eingeräumt werden, bleiben diesem allein vorbehalten. Soweit Datenbanken oder Zusammenstellungen von Daten Schutzgegenstand dieser Lizenz oder Teil dessen sind und einen immaterialgüterrechtlichen Schutz eigener Art genießen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber auf sämtliche aus diesem Schutz resultierenden Rechte. 4.

Licentie HET WERK (ALS HIERONDER OMSCHREVEN) WORDT TER BESCHIKKING GESTELD OVEREENKOMSTIG DE VOORWAARDEN VAN DEZE CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIEKE LICENTIE (''CCPL'' OF ''LICENTIE''). HET WERK WORDT BESCHERMD OP GROND VAN HET AUTEURSRECHT, NABURIGE RECHTEN, HET DATABANKENRECHT EN/OF ENIGE ANDERE TOEPASSELIJKE RECHTEN. MET UITZONDERING VAN HET IN DEZE LICENTIE OMSCHREVEN TOEGESTANE GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK IS ENIG ANDER GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK NIET TOEGESTAAN.

DE LICENTIEGEVER VERLEENT DE GEBRUIKER DE IN DEZE LICENTIE OMSCHREVEN RECHTEN MET INACHTNEMING VAN DE DESBETREFFENDE VOORWAARDEN. 1. Definities a. ''Verzamelwerk'' een werk waarin het Werk, in zijn geheel en in ongewijzigde vorm, samen met een of meer andere werken, die elk een afzonderlijk en zelfstandig werk vormen, tot een geheel is samengevoegd. Voorbeelden van een verzamelwerk zijn een tijdschrift, een bloemlezing of een encyclopedie. Een Verzamelwerk zal voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk (als hieronder omschreven) worden beschouwd. b. ''Afgeleid werk'' een werk dat is gebaseerd op het Werk of op het Werk en andere reeds bestaande werken. Voorbeelden van een Afgeleid werk zijn een vertaling, een muziekschikking (arrangement), een toneelbewerking, een literaire bewerking, een verfilming, een geluidsopname, een kunstreproductie, een verkorte versie, een samenvatting of enig andere bewerking van het Werk, met dien verstande dat een Verzamelwerk voor de toepassing van deze Licentie niet als een Afgeleid werk zal worden beschouwd. Indien het Werk een muziekwerk betreft, zal de synchronisatie van de tijdslijnen van het Werk en een bewegend beeld (''synching'') voor de toepassing van deze Licentie als een Afgeleid Werk worden beschouwd. c. ''Licentiegever'' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/rechtspersonen die het Werk volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie aanbiedt/aanbieden. d. ''Maker'' de natuurlijke persoon/personen of rechtspersoon/personen die het oorspronkelijke werk gemaakt heeft/hebben. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder de Maker mede verstaan de uitvoerende kunstenaar, film- en fonogramproducent en omroeporganisaties in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de producent van een databank in de zin van de Databankenwet. e. ''Werk'' het auteursrechtelijk beschermde werk dat volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie wordt aangeboden. Voor de toepassing van deze Licentie wordt onder het Werk mede verstaan het fonogram, de eerste vastlegging van een film en het (omroep)programma in de zin van de Wet op de naburige rechten en de databank in de zin van de Databankenwet, voor zover dit fonogram, deze eerste vastlegging van een film, dit (omroep)programma en deze databank beschermd wordt krachtens de toepasselijke wet in de jurisdictie van de Gebruiker. f. ''Gebruiker'' de natuurlijke persoon of rechtspersoon die rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uitoefent en die de voorwaarden van deze Licentie met betrekking tot het Werk niet eerder geschonden heeft, of die van de Licentiegever uitdrukkelijke toestemming gekregen heeft om rechten ingevolge deze Licentie uit te oefenen ondanks een eerdere schending. 2. Beperkingen van de uitsluitende rechten. Niets in deze Licentie strekt ertoe om de rechten te beperken die voortvloeien uit de beperkingen en uitputting van de uitsluitende rechten van de rechthebbende krachtens het auteursrecht, de naburige rechten, het databankenrecht of enige andere toepasselijke rechten. 3. Licentieverlening. Met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie verleent de Licentiegever hierbij aan de Gebruiker een wereldwijde, niet-exclusieve licentie om de navolgende rechten met betrekking tot het Werk vrij van royalty''s uit te oefenen voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten: a. het reproduceren van het Werk, het opnemen van het Werk in een of meerdere Verzamelwerken, en het reproduceren van het in de Verzamelwerken opgenomen Werk; b. het maken en reproduceren van Afgeleide werken met dien verstande dat met betrekking tot het Afgeleide werk, met inbegrip van welke vertaling in welk medium dan ook, duidelijk wordt gemaakt dat er wijzigingen in het oorspronkelijke Werk zijn aangebracht. Bijvoorbeeld, aan een vertaling kan worden toegevoegd dat ''het oorspronkelijke Werk is van het Engels in het Spaans vertaald'', of in geval van een verandering kan worden aangegeven dat ''het oorspronkelijke werk is veranderd''; c. het verspreiden van exemplaren van het Werk, het in het openbaar tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van het Werk, afzonderlijk en als deel van een Verzamelwerk; d. het verspreiden van exemplaren van Afgeleide werken, het in het openbaar te tonen, op- en uitvoeren en het on-line beschikbaar stellen van Afgeleide werken; e. het opvragen en hergebruiken van het Werk; f. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat: i. Niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen. in het geval van niet voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot thuiskopieën) de Licentiegever zich het recht voorbehoudt om dergelijke heffingen te innen (al dan niet door middel van een auteursrechtenorganisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk; ii. Voor afstand vatbare heffingsregeling. in het geval van voor afstand vatbare heffingsregelingen (bijvoorbeeld met betrekking tot leenrechten) de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om dergelijke heffingen te innen bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk; iii. Collectief rechtenbeheer. de Licentiegever afstand doet van het recht om vergoedingen te innen (zelfstandig of, indien de Licentiegever lid is van een auteursrechtenorganisatie, door middel van die organisatie) bij zowel commercieel als niet-commercieel gebruik van het Werk. De Gebruiker mag deze rechten uitoefenen met behulp van alle thans bekende media, dragers en formats. De Gebruiker is tevens gerechtigd om technische wijzigingen aan te brengen die noodzakelijk zijn om de rechten met behulp van andere media, dragers en formats uit te oefenen. Alle niet uitdrukkelijk verleende rechten zijn hierbij voorbehouden aan de Licentiegever, met inbegrip van maar niet beperkt tot de rechten die in artikel 4(d) worden genoemd. Voor zover de Licentiegever op basis van het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn over uitsluitende rechten beschickt doet de Licentiegever afstand van deze rechten. 4. Beperkingen. De in artikel 3 verleende Licentie is uitdrukkelijk gebonden aan de volgende beperkingen: a. De Gebruiker mag het Werk uitsluitend verspreiden, in het openbaar tonen, op- of uitvoeren of on-line beschikbaar stellen met inachtneming van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie, en de Gebruiker dient een exemplaar van, of de Uniform Resource Identifier voor, deze Licentie toe te voegen aan elk exemplaar van het Werk dat de Gebruiker verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert, of on-line beschikbaar stelt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk onder enige afwijkende voorwaarden aan te bieden waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk in sublicentie te geven. De Gebruiker dient alle vermeldingen die verwijzen naar deze Licentie dan wel naar de uitsluiting van garantie te laten staan. Het is de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om het Werk te verspreiden, in het openbaar te tonen, op- of uit te voeren of on-line beschikbaar te stellen met toepassing van technologische voorzieningen waardoor de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dan wel de mogelijkheid van de ontvangers van het Werk om de rechten krachtens deze Licentie uit te oefenen worden beperkt. Het voorgaande is tevens van toepassing op het Werk dat deel uitmaakt van een Verzamelwerk, maar dat houdt niet in dat het Verzamelwerk, afgezien van het Werk zelf, gebonden is aan de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. Indien de Gebruiker een Verzamelwerk maakt, dient deze, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(b) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Verzamelwerk te verwijderen, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek. Indien de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk maakt, dient hij, op verzoek van welke Licentiegever ook, de op grond van artikel 4(b) vereiste naamsvermelding uit het Afgeleide werk te verwijderen, voorzover praktisch mogelijk, conform het verzoek. b. Indien de Gebruiker het Werk, Afgeleide Werken of Verzamelwerken verspreidt, in het openbaar toont, op- of uitvoert of on-line beschikbaar stelt, dient de Gebruiker, tenzij er sprake is van een verzoek als vermeld in lid 4(a), alle auteursrechtvermeldingen met betrekking tot het Werk te laten staan. Tevens dient de Gebruiker, op een wijze die redelijk is in verhouding tot het gebruikte medium, de naam te vermelden van (i) de Maker (of zijn/haar pseudoniem indien van toepassing) indien deze wordt vermeld; en/of (ii) van (een) andere partij(en) (b.v. sponsor, uitgeverij, tijdschrift) indien de naamsvermelding van deze partij(en) ('"Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden'") in de auteursrechtvermelding of algemene voorwaarden van de Licentiegever of op een andere redelijke wijze verplicht is gesteld door de Maker en/of de Licentiegever; de titel van het Werk indien deze wordt vermeld; voorzover redelijkerwijs toepasbaar de Uniform Resource Identifier, indien aanwezig, waarvan de Licentiegever heeft aangegeven dat deze bij het Werk hoort, tenzij de URI niet verwijst naar de auteursrechtvermeldingen of de licentie-informatie betreffende het Werk; in overeenstemming met artikel 3(b) in geval van een Afgeleid werk, door te verwijzen naar het gebruik van het Werk in het Afgeleide werk (bijvoorbeeld: ''De Franse vertaling van het Werk van de Maker'' of ''Scenario gebaseerd op het Werk van de Maker''). De Gebruiker dient op redelijke wijze aan de in dit artikel genoemde vereisten te voldoen; echter, met dien verstande dat, in geval van een Afgeleid werk of een Verzamelwerk, de naamsvermeldingen in ieder geval geplaatst dienen te worden, indien er een naamsvermelding van alle makers van het Afgeleide werk of het Verzamelwerk geplaatst wordt dan als deel van die naamsvermeldingen, en op een wijze die in ieder geval even duidelijk is als de naamsvermeldingen van de overige makers. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld dat de Gebruiker uitsluitend gebruik mag maken van de naamsvermelding op de in dit artikel omschreven wijze teneinde te voldoen aan de naamsvermeldingsverplichting en, door gebruikmaking van zijn rechten krachtens deze Licentie, is het de Gebruiker niet toegestaan om op enigerlei wijze de indruk te wekken dat er sprake is van enig verband met, sponsorschap van of goedkeuring van de (toepasselijke) Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden van de Gebruiker of diens gebruik van het Werk, zonder de afzonderlijke, uitdrukkelijke, voorafgaande, schriftelijke toestemming van de Maker, Licentiegever c.q. Naamsvermeldingsgerechtigden. c. Volledigheidshalve dient te worden vermeld, dat de hierboven vermelde beperkingen (lid 4(a) en lid 4(b)) niet van toepassing zijn op die onderdelen van het Werk die geacht worden te vallen onder de definitie van het ''Werk'' zoals vermeld in deze Licentie uitsluitend omdat zij voldoen aan de criteria van het sui generis databankenrecht krachtens het nationale recht ter implementatie van de Europese Databankenrichtlijn. d. De in artikel 3 verleende rechten moeten worden uitgeoefend met inachtneming van het morele recht van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) om zich te verzetten tegen elke misvorming, verminking of andere aantasting van het werk, welke nadeel zou kunnen toebrengen aan de eer of de naam van de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) of aan zijn waarde in deze hoedanigheid, indien en voor zover de Maker (en/of de uitvoerende kunstenaar) op grond van een op hem van toepassing zijnde wettelijke bepaling geen afstand kan doen van dat morele recht. 5. Garantie en vrijwaring. TENZIJ ANDERS SCHRIFTELIJK IS OVEREENGEKOMEN DOOR DE PARTIJEN, STELT DE LICENTIEGEVER HET WERK BESCHIKBAAR OP ''AS-IS'' BASIS, ZONDER ENIGE GARANTIE, HETZIJ DIRECT, INDIRECT OF ANDERSZINS, MET BETREKKING TOT HET WERK, MET INBEGRIP VAN, MAAR NIET BEPERKT TOT GARANTIES MET BETREKKING TOT DE EIGENDOMSTITEL, DE VERKOOPBAARHEID, DE GESCHIKTHEID VOOR BEPAALDE DOELEINDEN, MOGELIJKE INBREUK, DE AFWEZIGHEID VAN LATENTE OF ANDERE TEKORTKOMINGEN, DE JUISTHEID OF DE AAN- OF AFWEZIGHEID VAN FOUTEN, ONGEACHT DE OPSPOORBAARHEID DAARVAN, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT. 6. Beperking van de aansprakelijkheid. DE LICENTIEGEVER AANVAARDT GEEN ENKELE AANSPRAKELIJKHEID JEGENS DE GEBRUIKER VOOR ENIGE BIJZONDERE OF INCIDENTELE SCHADE OF GEVOLGSCHADE VOORTVLOEIEND UIT DEZE LICENTIE OF HET GEBRUIK VAN HET WERK, ZELFS NIET INDIEN DE LICENTIEGEVER OP DE HOOGTE IS GESTELD VAN HET RISICO VAN DERGELIJKE SCHADE, INDIEN EN VOORZOVER DE WET NIET ANDERS BEPAALT. 7. Beëindiging a. Deze Licentie en de daarin verleende rechten vervallen automatisch op het moment dat de Gebruiker in strijd handelt met de voorwaarden van deze Licentie. De licenties van natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen die Verzamelwerken hebben ontvangen van de Gebruiker krachtens deze Licentie blijven echter in stand zolang dergelijke natuurlijke personen of rechtspersonen zich houden aan de voorwaarden van die licenties. Na de beëindiging van deze Licentie blijven artikelen 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 en 8 onverminderd van kracht. b. Met inachtneming van de hierboven vermelde voorwaarden wordt de Licentie verleend voor de duur van de toepasselijke intellectuele eigendomsrechten op het Werk. De Licentiegever behoudt zich desalniettemin te allen tijde het recht voor om het Werk volgens gewijzigde licentievoorwaarden te verspreiden of om het Werk niet langer te verspreiden; met dien verstande dat een dergelijk besluit niet de intrekking van deze Licentie (of enig andere licentie die volgens de voorwaarden van deze Licentie (verplicht) is verleend) tot gevolg heeft, en deze Licentie onverminderd van kracht blijft tenzij zij op de in lid a omschreven wijze wordt beëindigd. 8. Diversen a. Elke keer dat de Gebruiker het Werk of een Verzamelwerk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het Werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie. b. Elke keer dat de Gebruiker een Afgeleid werk verspreidt of on-line beschikbaar stelt, biedt de Licentiegever de ontvanger een licentie op het oorspronkelijke werk aan volgens de algemene voorwaarden van deze Licentie. c. Indien enige bepaling van deze Licentie nietig of niet rechtens afdwingbaar is, zullen de overige voorwaarden van deze Licentie volledig van kracht blijven. De nietige of niet-afdwingbare bepaling zal, zonder tussenkomst van de partijen, worden vervangen door een geldige en afdwingbare bepaling waarbij het doel en de strekking van de oorspronkelijke bepaling zoveel mogelijk in acht worden genomen. d. Een verklaring van afstand van in deze Licentie verleende rechten of een wijziging van de voorwaarden van deze Licentie dient schriftelijk te geschieden en getekend te zijn door de partij die verantwoordelijk is voor de verklaring van afstand respectievelijk de partij wiens toestemming voor de wijziging is vereist. f. Deze Licentie bevat de volledige overeenkomst tussen de partijen met betrekking tot het in licentie gegeven Werk. Er zijn geen andere afspraken gemaakt met betrekking tot het Werk. De Licentiegever is niet gebonden aan enige aanvullende bepalingen die worden vermeld in mededelingen van de Gebruiker. Deze licentie kan uitsluitend worden gewijzigd met de wederzijdse, schriftelijke instemming van de Licentiegever en de Gebruiker. Aansprakelijkheid en merkrechten van Creative Commons Creative Commons is geen partij bij deze Licentie en stelt geen enkele garantie met betrekking tot het Werk. Creative Commons kan op geen enkele wijze aansprakelijk worden gehouden jegens de Gebruiker of derden voor enigerlei schade met inbegrip van, maar niet beperkt tot enige algemene, bijzondere, incidentele of gevolgschade voortvloeiend uit deze Licentie. Onverminderd het bepaalde in de twee (2) voorgaande volzinnen is Creative Commons gebonden aan alle rechten en verplichtingen van de Licentiegever indien Creative Commons zichzelf uitdrukkelijk kenbaar gemaakt heeft als de Licentiegever krachtens deze Licentie. Met uitzondering van het beperkte doel om iedereen erop te wijzen dat het Werk in licentie is gegeven krachtens de CCPL, geeft Creative Commons aan geen van de partijen toestemming om gebruik te maken van de merknaam ''Creative Commons'', enige daarmee verband houdende merknamen dan wel het logo van Creative Commons gebruiken zonder de voorafgaande schriftelijke toestemming van Creative Commons.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. **Section 1 – Definitions.** 1. **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. 2. **Adapter''s License** means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. 3. **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section [2(b)(1)-(2)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2b) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. 4. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. 5. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. 6. **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. 7. **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. 8. **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. 9. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. 10. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 11. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. **Your** has a corresponding meaning. **Section 2 – Scope.** 1. **License grant**. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and 2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section [2(a)(4)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. 1. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. 2. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai). 2. **Other rights**. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. **Section 3 – License Conditions.** Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. 1. **Attribution**. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: 1. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: 1. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); 2. a copyright notice; 3. a notice that refers to this Public License; 4. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; 5. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; 2. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and 3. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section [3(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section [3(a)(1)(A)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter''s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. **Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.** Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: 1. for the avoidance of doubt, Section [2(a)(1)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; 2. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and 3. You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s4) supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. **Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.** 1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.** 2. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.** 1. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. **Section 6 – Term and Termination.** 1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. 2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section [6(a)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. 3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. 4. Sections [1](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s1), [5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s5), [6](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6), [7](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s7), and [8](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s8) survive termination of this Public License. **Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.** 1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. 2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. **Section 8 – Interpretation.** 1. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. 2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. 3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. 4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at [creativecommons.org/policies](http://creativecommons.org/policies), Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('"Commons'") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the '"Affirmer'"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. **1\. Copyright and Related Rights.** A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('"Copyright and Related Rights'"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; 2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); 3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person''s image or likeness depicted in a Work; 4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; 5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; 6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and 7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. **2\. Waiver.** To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer''s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the '"Waiver'"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer''s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer''s express Statement of Purpose. **3\. Public License Fallback.** Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer''s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer''s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the '"License'"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer''s express Statement of Purpose. **4\. Limitations and Disclaimers.** 1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. 2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. 3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person''s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. 4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work. "

Permission is granted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this License, but changing or adding to it in any way is not permitted. Please read this License carefully before downloading or using this material. By downloading or using this material, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use this material. 0.Preamble. The Common Documentation License (CDL) provides a very simple and consistent license that allows relatively unrestricted use and redistribution of documents while still maintaining the author''s credit and intent. To preserve simplicity, the License does not specify in detail how (e.g. font size) or where (e.g. title page, etc.) the author should be credited. To preserve consistency, changes to the CDL are not allowed and all derivatives of CDL documents are required to remain under the CDL. Together, these constraints enable third parties to easily and safely reuse CDL documents, making the CDL ideal for authors who desire a wide distribution of their work. However, this means the CDL does not allow authors to restrict precisely how their work is used or represented, making it inappropriate for those desiring more finely-grained control. 1.General; Definitions. This License applies to any documentation, manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the Copyright Holder stating that it is subject to the terms of this Common Documentation License version 1.0 (or subsequent version thereof) ('"License'"). As used in this License: 1.1'"Copyright Holder'" means the original author(s) of the Document or other owner(s) of the copyright in the Document. 1.2'"Document(s)'" means any documentation, manual or other work that has been identified as being subject to the terms of this License. 1.3'"Derivative Work'" means a work which is based upon a pre-existing Document, such as a revision, modification, translation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other form in which such pre-existing Document may be recast, transformed, or adapted. 1.4'"You'" or '"Your'" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. 2.Basic License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this License, You may use, copy, modify, publicly display, distribute and publish the Document and your Derivative Works thereof, in any medium physical or electronic, commercially or non-commercially; provided that: (a) all copyright notices in the Document are preserved; (b) a copy of this License, or an incorporation of it by reference in proper form as indicated in Exhibit A below, is included in a conspicuous location in all copies such that it would be reasonably viewed by the recipient of the Document; and (c) You add no other terms or conditions to those of this License. 3.Derivative Works. All Derivative Works are subject to the terms of this License. You may copy and distribute a Derivative Work of the Document under the conditions of Section 2 above, provided that You release the Derivative Work under the exact, verbatim terms of this License (i.e., the Derivative Work is licensed as a '"Document'" under the terms of this License). In addition, Derivative Works of Documents must meet the following requirements: (a)All copyright and license notices in the original Document must be preserved. (b)An appropriate copyright notice for your Derivative Work must be added adjacent to the other copyright notices. (c)A statement briefly summarizing how your Derivative Work is different from the original Document must be included in the same place as your copyright notice. (d)If it is not reasonably evident to a recipient of your Derivative Work that the Derivative Work is subject to the terms of this License, a statement indicating such fact must be included in the same place as your copyright notice. 4.Compilation with Independent Works. You may compile or combine a Document or its Derivative Works with other separate and independent documents or works to create a compilation work ('"Compilation'"). If included in a Compilation, the Document or Derivative Work thereof must still be provided under the terms of this License, and the Compilation shall contain (a) a notice specifying the inclusion of the Document and/or Derivative Work and the fact that it is subject to the terms of this License, and (b) either a copy of the License or an incorporation by reference in proper form (as indicated in Exhibit A). Mere aggregation of a Document or Derivative Work with other documents or works on the same storage or distribution medium (e.g. a CD-ROM) will not cause this License to apply to those other works. 5.NO WARRANTY. THE DOCUMENT IS PROVIDED ''AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DOCUMENT, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. 6.LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, DISTRIBUTION AND/OR PUBLICATION OF THE DOCUMENT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. 7.Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use any names, trademarks, service marks or logos of the Copyright Holder (collectively '"Marks'") and no such Marks may be used to endorse or promote works or products derived from the Document without the prior written permission of the Copyright Holder. 8.Versions of the License. Apple Computer, Inc. ('"Apple'") may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once a Document has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Document under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Documents created under this License. 9.Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, You must immediately stop any further reproduction, modification, public display, distr ibution and publication of the Document and Derivative Works. However, all sublicenses to the Document and Derivative Works which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nat ure, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. 10.Waiver; Severability; Governing Law. Failure by the Copyright Holder to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. EXHIBIT A The proper form for an incorporation of this License by reference is as follows: '"Copyright (c) [year] by [Copyright Holder''s name]. This material has been released under and is subject to the terms of the Common Documentation License, v.1.0, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Data is provided to You under this Agreement by each of the Data Providers. Your exercise of any of the rights and permissions granted below constitutes Your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The benefits that each Data Provider receives from making Data available and that You receive from Data or otherwise under these terms and conditions shall be deemed sufficient consideration for the formation of this Agreement. Accordingly, Data Provider(s) and You (the “Parties”) agree as follows: Section 1. Definitions 1.1 “Add” means to supplement Data with Your own or someone else’s Data, resulting in Your “Additions.” Additions do not include Results. 1.2 “Computational Use” means Your analysis (through the use of computational devices or otherwise) or other interpretation of Data. By way of example and not limitation, “Computational Use” includes the application of any computational analytical technique, the purpose of which is the analysis of any Data in digital form to generate information about Data such as patterns, trends, correlations, inferences, insights and attributes. 1.3 “Data” means the information (including copyrightable information, such as images or text), collectively or individually, whether created or gathered by a Data Provider or an Entity acting on its behalf, to which rights are granted under this Agreement. 1.4 “Data Provider” means any Entity (including any employee or contractor of such Entity authorized to Publish Data on behalf of such Entity) that Publishes Data under this Agreement prior to Your Receiving it. 1.5 “Enhanced Data” means the subset of Data that You Publish and that is composed of (a) Your Additions and/or (b) Modifications to Data You have received under this Agreement. 1.6 “Entity” means any natural person or organization that exists under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, together with all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (a) the power, directly or indirectly, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (b) the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or securities, (c) the beneficial ownership of such entity or, (d) the ability to appoint, whether by agreement or right, the majority of directors of an Entity. 1.7 “Modify” means to delete, erase, correct or re-arrange Data, resulting in “Modifications.” Modifications do not include Results. 1.8 “Publish” means to make all or a subset of Data (including Your Enhanced Data) available in any manner which enables its Use, including by providing a copy on physical media or remote access. For any form of Entity, that is to make the Data available to any individual who is not employed by that Entity or engaged as a contractor or agent to perform work on that Entity’s behalf. A “Publication” occurs each time You Publish Data. 1.9 “Receive” or “Receives” means to have been given access to Data, locally or remotely. 1.10 “Results” means the outcomes or outputs that You obtain from Your Computational Use of Data. Results shall not include more than a de minimis portion of the Data on which the Computational Use is based. 1.11 “Sui Generis Database Rights” means rights, other than copyright, resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 1.12 “Use” means using Data (including accessing, copying, studying, reviewing, adapting, analyzing, evaluating, or making Computational Use of it), either by machines or humans, or a combination of both. 1.13 “You” or “Your” means any Entity that Receives Data under this Agreement.

Right and License to Use and to Publish 2.1 Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement, Data Provider(s) hereby grant(s) to You a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as provided in Section 5) right to: (a) Use Data; and (b) Publish Data. 2.2 To the extent that the Data or the coordination, selection or arrangement of Data is protected or protectable under copyright, Sui Generis Database Rights, or other law, Data Provider(s) further agree(s) that such Data or coordination, selection or arrangement is hereby licensed to You and to anyone else who Receives Data under this Agreement for Use and Publication, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement. 2.3 Except for these rights and licenses expressly granted, no other intellectual property rights are granted or should be implied. Section 3. Conditions on Rights Granted 3.1 If You Publish Data You Receive or Enhanced Data: (a) You may do so under a license of Your choice provided that You give anyone who Receives the Data from You the text of this Agreement, the name of this Agreement and/or a hyperlink or other method reasonably likely to provide a copy of the text of this Agreement; and (b) You must cause any Data files containing Enhanced Data to carry prominent notices that You have changed those files; and (c) If You Publish Data You Receive, You must preserve all credit or attribution to the Data Provider(s). Such retained credit or attribution includes any of the following to the extent they exist in Data as You have Received it: legal notices or metadata; identification of the Data Provider(s); or hyperlinks to Data to the extent it is practical to do so. 3.2 You may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of that Enhanced Data, or for any combination of Data and Enhanced Data as a whole, provided that Your Use and Publication of that combined Data otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 3.3 You and each Data Provider agree that Enhanced Data shall not be considered a work of joint authorship by virtue of its relationship to Data licensed under this Agreement and shall not require either any obligation of accounting to or the consent of any Data Provider. 3.4 This Agreement imposes no obligations or restrictions on Your Use or Publication of Results. Section 4. Data Provider(s)’ Representations 4.1 Each Data Provider represents that the Data Provider has exercised reasonable care, to assure that: (a) the Data it Publishes was created or generated by it or was obtained from others with the right to Publish the Data under this Agreement; and (b) Publication of such Data does not violate any privacy or confidentiality obligation undertaken by the Data Provider. Section 5. Termination 5.1 All of Your rights under this Agreement will terminate, and Your right to Receive, Use or Publish the Data will be revoked or modified if You materially fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and You do not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Your rights under this Agreement terminate, You agree to cease Receipt, Use and Publication of Data. However, Your obligations and any rights and permissions granted by You under this Agreement relating to Data that You Published prior to such termination will continue and survive. 5.2 If You institute litigation against a Data Provider or anyone else who Receives the Data (including a cross-claim in a lawsuit) based on the Data, other than a claim asserting breach of this Agreement, then any rights previously granted to You to Receive, Use and Publish Data under this Agreement will terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Section 7. Miscellaneous 7.1 You agree that it is solely Your responsibility to comply with all applicable laws with regard to Your Use or Publication of Data, including any applicable privacy, data protection, security and export laws. You agree to take reasonable steps to assist a Data Provider fulfilling responsibilities to comply with applicable laws with regard to Use or Publication of Data Received hereunder. 7.2 You and Data Provider(s), collectively and individually, waive and/or agree not to assert, to the extent permitted by law, any moral rights You or they hold in Data. 7.3 This Agreement confers no rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than the Parties and their respective heirs, executors, successors and assigns. 7.4 The Data Provider(s) reserve no right or expectation of privacy, data protection or confidentiality in any Data that they Publish under this Agreement. If You choose to Publish Data under this Agreement, You similarly do so with no reservation or expectation of any rights of privacy or confidentiality in that Data. 7.5 The Community Data License Agreement workgroup under The Linux Foundation is the steward of this Agreement (“Steward”). No one other than the Steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this Agreement. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. You may Use and Publish Data Received hereunder under the terms of the version of the Agreement under which You originally Received the Data, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the Steward."

A cet égard l''attention de l''utilisateur est attirée sur les risques associés au chargement, à l''utilisation, à la modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l''utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester l''adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions permettant d''assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à l''utiliser et l''exploiter dans les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l''état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses. Ce contrat est susceptible de s''appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l''exploitation aux dispositions qu''il contient.

Article 7 - SERVICES ASSOCIES 7.1 Le Contrat n''oblige en aucun cas le Concédant à la réalisation de prestations d''assistance technique ou de maintenance du Logiciel. Cependant le Concédant reste libre de proposer ce type de services. Les termes et conditions d''une telle assistance technique et/ou d''une telle maintenance seront alors déterminés dans un acte séparé. Ces actes de maintenance et/ou assistance technique n''engageront que la seule responsabilité du Concédant qui les propose. 7.2 De même, tout Concédant est libre de proposer, sous sa seule responsabilité, à ses licenciés une garantie, qui n''engagera que lui, lors de la redistribution du Logiciel et/ou du Logiciel Modifié et ce, dans les conditions qu''il souhaite. Cette garantie et les modalités financières de son application feront l''objet d''un acte séparé entre le Concédant et le Licencié. Article 8 - RESPONSABILITE 8.1 Sous réserve des dispositions de l''article 8.2, le Licencié a la faculté, sous réserve de prouver la faute du Concédant concerné, de solliciter la réparation du préjudice direct qu''il subirait du fait du Logiciel et dont il apportera la preuve. 8.2 La responsabilité du Concédant est limitée aux engagements pris en application du Contrat et ne saurait être engagée en raison notamment: (i) des dommages dus à l''inexécution, totale ou partielle, de ses obligations par le Licencié, (ii) des dommages directs ou indirects découlant de l''utilisation ou des performances du Logiciel subis par le Licencié et (iii) plus généralement d''un quelconque dommage indirect. En particulier, les Parties conviennent expressément que tout préjudice financier ou commercial (par exemple perte de données, perte de bénéfices, perte d''exploitation, perte de clientèle ou de commandes, manque à gagner, trouble commercial quelconque) ou toute action dirigée contre le Licencié par un tiers, constitue un dommage indirect et n''ouvre pas droit à réparation par le Concédant. Article 9 - GARANTIE 9.1 Le Licencié reconnaît que l''état actuel des connaissances scientifiques et techniques au moment de la mise en circulation du Logiciel ne permet pas d''en tester et d''en vérifier toutes les utilisations ni de détecter l''existence d''éventuels défauts. L''attention du Licencié a été attirée sur ce point sur les risques associés au chargement, à l''utilisation, la modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis. Il relève de la responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens, l''adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de s''assurer qu''il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux biens. 9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de concéder l''ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant notamment les droits visés à l''article 5). 9.3 Le Licencié reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni '"en l''état'" par le Concédant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à l''article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent. En particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt d''erreur, qu''il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu''il sera compatible avec l''équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni qu''il remplira les besoins du Licencié. 9.4 Le Concédant ne garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété intellectuelle d''un tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au profit du Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être diligentées au titre de l''utilisation, de la modification, et de la redistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont exercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide technique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et juridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et le Licencié dans le cadre d''un protocole d''accord. Le Concédant dégage toute responsabilité quant à l''utilisation de la dénomination du Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n''est apportée quant à l''existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur l''existence d''une marque. Article 10 - RESILIATION 10.1 En cas de manquement par le Licencié aux obligations mises à sa charge par le Contrat, le Concédant pourra résilier de plein droit le Contrat trente (30) jours après notification adressée au Licencié et restée sans effet. 10.2 Le Licencié dont le Contrat est résilié n''est plus autorisé à utiliser, modifier ou distribuer le Logiciel. Cependant, toutes les licences qu''il aura concédées antérieurement à la résiliation du Contrat resteront valides sous réserve qu''elles aient été effectuées en conformité avec le Contrat. Article 11 - DISPOSITIONS DIVERSES 11.1 CAUSE EXTERIEURE Aucune des Parties ne sera responsable d''un retard ou d''une défaillance d''exécution du Contrat qui serait dû à un cas de force majeure, un cas fortuit ou une cause extérieure, telle que, notamment, le mauvais fonctionnement ou les interruptions du réseau électrique ou de télécommunication, la paralysie du réseau liée à une attaque informatique, l''intervention des autorités gouvernementales, les catastrophes naturelles, les dégâts des eaux, les tremblements de terre, le feu, les explosions, les grèves et les conflits sociaux, l''état de guerre... 11.2 Le fait, par l''une ou l''autre des Parties, d''omettre en une ou plusieurs occasions de se prévaloir d''une ou plusieurs dispositions du Contrat, ne pourra en aucun cas impliquer renonciation par la Partie intéressée à s''en prévaloir ultérieurement. 11.3 Le Contrat annule et remplace toute convention antérieure, écrite ou orale, entre les Parties sur le même objet et constitue l''accord entier entre les Parties sur cet objet. Aucune addition ou modification aux termes du Contrat n''aura d''effet à l''égard des Parties à moins d''être faite par écrit et signée par leurs représentants dûment habilités. 11.4 Dans l''hypothèse où une ou plusieurs des dispositions du Contrat s''avèrerait contraire à une loi ou à un texte applicable, existants ou futurs, cette loi ou ce texte prévaudrait, et les Parties feraient les amendements nécessaires pour se conformer à cette loi ou à ce texte. Toutes les autres dispositions resteront en vigueur. De même, la nullité, pour quelque raison que ce soit, d''une des dispositions du Contrat ne saurait entraîner la nullité de l''ensemble du Contrat. 11.5 LANGUE Le Contrat est rédigé en langue française et en langue anglaise, ces deux versions faisant également foi. Article 12 - NOUVELLES VERSIONS DU CONTRAT 12.1 Toute personne est autorisée à copier et distribuer des copies de ce Contrat. 12.2 Afin d''en préserver la cohérence, le texte du Contrat est protégé et ne peut être modifié que par les auteurs de la licence, lesquels se réservent le droit de publier périodiquement des mises à jour ou de nouvelles versions du Contrat, qui posséderont chacune un numéro distinct.

Article 13 - LOI APPLICABLE ET COMPETENCE TERRITORIALE 13.1 Le Contrat est régi par la loi française. Les Parties conviennent de tenter de régler à l''amiable les différends ou litiges qui viendraient à se produire par suite ou à l''occasion du Contrat. 13.2 A défaut d''accord amiable dans un délai de deux (2) mois à compter de leur survenance et sauf situation relevant d''une procédure d''urgence, les différends ou litiges seront portés par la Partie la plus diligente devant les Tribunaux compétents de Paris. 1 CeCILL est pour Ce(a) C(nrs) I(nria) L(ogiciel) L(ibre) Version 1.0 du 2006-09-05.'""
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab00105,CERN-OHL-1.2,CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2,https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-1.2.html,f,f,t,low,-,f,-,[],[],[],[],"CERN OHL v1.2 2013-09-06 - CERN, Geneva, Switzerland CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2 Preamble Through this CERN Open Hardware Licence ('"CERN OHL'") version 1.2, CERN wishes to provide a tool to foster collaboration and sharing among hardware designers. The CERN OHL is copyright CERN. Anyone is welcome to use the CERN OHL, in unmodified form only, for the distribution of their own Open Hardware designs. Any other right is reserved. Release of hardware designs under the CERN OHL does not constitute an endorsement of the licensor or its designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in the development of such designs. 1. Definitions In this Licence, the following terms have the following meanings: '"Licence'" means this CERN OHL. '"Documentation'" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made available under the conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and representations on paper, film, or any other media. '"Documentation Location'" means a location where the Licensor has placed Documentation, and which he believes will be publicly accessible for at least three years from the first communication to the public or distribution of Documentation. '"Product'" means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Documentation or the modified Documentation. '"Licensee'" means any natural or legal person exercising rights under this Licence. '"Licensor'" means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies Documentation and subsequently communicates to the public and/ or distributes the resulting Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence. A Licensee may at the same time be a Licensor, and vice versa. Use of the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders and is employed solely to facilitate reading. 2. Applicability 2.1. This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution of the Documentation, and the manufacture and distribution of Products. By exercising any right granted under this Licence, the Licensee irrevocably accepts these terms and conditions. 2.2. This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to the Licensee, and shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time. The Licensee may assign his licence rights or grant sub-licences. 2.3. This Licence does not extend to software, firmware, or code loaded into programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with the Documentation, the modified Documentation or with Products, unless such software, firmware, or code is explicitly expressed to be subject to this Licence. The use of such software, firmware, or code is otherwise subject to the applicable licence terms and conditions. 3. Copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution of the Documentation 3.1. The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright and trademarks notices, all notices referring to Documentation Location, and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Documentation. He shall include a copy thereof in every copy of the Documentation or, as the case may be, modified Documentation, that he communicates to the public or distributes. 3.2. The Licensee may copy, communicate to the public and distribute verbatim copies of the Documentation, in any medium, subject to the requirements specified in section 3.1. 3.3. The Licensee may modify the Documentation or any portion thereof provided that upon modification of the Documentation, the Licensee shall make the modified Documentation available from a Documentation Location such that it can be easily located by an original Licensor once the Licensee communicates to the public or distributes the modified Documentation under section 3.4, and, where required by section 4.1, by a recipient of a Product. However, the Licensor shall not assert his rights under the foregoing proviso unless or until a Product is distributed. 3.4. The Licensee may communicate to the public and distribute the modified Documentation (thereby in addition to being a Licensee also becoming a Licensor), always provided that he shall: a) comply with section 3.1; b) cause the modified Documentation to carry prominent notices stating that the Licensee has modified the Documentation, with the date and description of the modifications; c) cause the modified Documentation to carry a new Documentation Location notice if the original Documentation provided for one; d) make available the modified Documentation at the same level of abstraction as that of the Documentation, in the preferred format for making modifications to it (e.g. the native format of the CAD tool as applicable), and in the event that format is proprietary, in a format viewable with a tool licensed under an OSI-approved license if the proprietary tool can create it; and e) license the modified Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence or, where applicable, a later version of this Licence as may be issued by CERN. 3.5. The Licence includes a non-exclusive licence to those patents or registered designs that are held by, under the control of, or sub-licensable by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted under this Licence. The scope of this section 3.5 shall be strictly limited to the parts of the Documentation or modified Documentation created by the Licensor. 4. Manufacture and distribution of Products 4.1. The Licensee may manufacture or distribute Products always provided that, where such manufacture or distribution requires a licence under this Licence the Licensee provides to each recipient of such Products an easy means of accessing a copy of the Documentation or modified Documentation, as applicable, as set out in section 3. 4.2. The Licensee is invited to inform any Licensor who has indicated his wish to receive this information about the type, quantity and dates of production of Products the Licensee has (had) manufactured 5. Warranty and liability 5.1. DISCLAIMER – The Documentation and any modified Documentation are provided '"as is'" and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of the Documentation, the modified Documentation or any Product. The Licensor makes no representation that the Documentation, modified Documentation, or any Product, does or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of a Product shall be with the Licensee and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence. The Licensee warrants that it does not act in a consumer capacity. 5.2. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY – The Licensor shall have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Documentation, modified Documentation and/or the use, manufacture or distribution of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, and the Licensee shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to such use. 6. General 6.1. Except for the rights explicitly granted hereunder, this Licence does not imply or represent any transfer or assignment of intellectual property rights to the Licensee. 6.2. The Licensee shall not use or make reference to any of the names (including acronyms and abbreviations), images, or logos under which the Licensor is known, save in so far as required to comply with section 3. Any such permitted use or reference shall be factual and shall in no event suggest any kind of endorsement by the Licensor or its personnel of the modified Documentation or any Product, or any kind of implication by the Licensor or its personnel in the preparation of the modified Documentation or Product. 6.3. CERN may publish updated versions of this Licence which retain the same general provisions as this version, but differ in detail so far this is required and reasonable. New versions will be published with a unique version number. 6.4. This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect, upon written notice and without involvement of a court if the Licensee fails to comply with any of its terms and conditions, or if the Licensee initiates legal action against Licensor in relation to this Licence. Section 5 shall continue to apply."

New versions of the licence The licensee may choose to use the information covered by this licence under any new versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD) issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs) when these versions are final and official, unless the licensor when making the information available under this licence specifically has stated that solely version 1.0 of this licence may be used. 11. Governing law and legal venue This licence, including its formation, and any disputes and claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence, shall be regulated by Norwegian law.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with another license for the contents. Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License. The Licensor (as defined below) and You (as defined below) agree as follows: 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words ��Collective Database�� �C Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not be considered a Derivative Database. ��Convey�� �C As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. ��Contents�� �C The contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds. ��Database�� �C A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this License. ��Database Directive�� �C Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded. ��Database Right�� �C Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (��sui generis��) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. ��Derivative Database�� �C Means a database based upon the Database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database. ��Extraction�� �C Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form. ��License�� �C Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract. ��Licensor�� �C Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this License. ��Person�� �C Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate. ��Produced Work�� �C a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database. ��Publicly�� �C means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). ��Re-utilisation�� �C means any form of making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission. ��Substantial�� �C Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents. ��Use�� �C As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format. ��You�� �C Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. 2.0 What this License covers 2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is: a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights; b. A license of the Database Right; and c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor. 2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database, including: a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the Database; b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this License. 2.3 Rights not covered. a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database; b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database. 2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images. 3.0 Rights granted 3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future. The rights granted cover, for example: a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents; b. Creation of Derivative Databases; c. Creation of Collective Databases; d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases. 3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt: a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. 3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved. 4.0 Conditions of Use 4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of its terms. 4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must: a. Do so only under the terms of this License; b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License; and d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it. 4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License. a.

DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the location of the Database. ��ODC Attribution License�� should contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI��s with the above notice. 4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. 5.0 Moral rights 5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author��s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment: a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database. Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions. 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected 6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database, including without limitation: a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure. b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. 6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents. 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer 7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor ��as is�� and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You. 8.0 Limitation of liability 8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Licensor. 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License 9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this License. 9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it. 9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the duration of applicable rights in the Database. 9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated: a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach; b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. 9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 10.0 General 10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database. 10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License."

REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction. Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows: Copyright (c) <year> by <author''s name or designee>. This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later (the latest version is presently available at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/). The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI). Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is permitted. Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author''s names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all outer surfaces of the book the original publisher''s name shall be as large as the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the title. II. COPYRIGHT The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or designee. III. SCOPE OF LICENSE The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document. Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright notice. SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license remain in force. NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided '"as is'" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement. IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet the following requirements: 1. The modified version must be labeled as such. 2. The person making the modifications must be identified and the modifications dated. 3. Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation practices. 4. The location of the original unmodified document must be identified. 5. The original author''s (or authors'') name(s) may not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without the original author''s (or authors'') permission. V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended of redistributors that: 1. If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any, made to the document. 2. All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an attachment to the document. 3. Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its author(s). VI. LICENSE OPTIONS The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference to or copy of the license.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac00088,PDDL-1.0,ODC Public Domain Dedication & License 1.0,https://spdx.org/licenses/PDDL-1.0.html,f,f,t,low,该协议不包含实质性的限制条款,f,-,[],[],[],[],"Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & License (PDDL) Preamble The Open Data Commons ? Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on databases or their contents ('"data'"), either together or individually. Many databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the '"sui generis'" database right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a '"some rights reserved'" approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data. The position of the recipient of the work Because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others. The position of the dedicator of the work Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of '"intellectual property'", is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims. The purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to '"dual license'" their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can��t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts. This document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content ? not just factual data ? rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons ? Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights. Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to the '"Work'", which can be either ? or both ? the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it. Just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document. This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen. Part I: Introduction The Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as follows: 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words '"Copyright'" ? Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and similarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4. '"Data'" ? The contents of the Database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the Database offered under the terms of this Document. '"Database'" ? A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this Document. '"Database Right'" ? Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III ('"sui generis'") rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases) and any future updates as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4. '"Document'" ? means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back up licence agreement. '"Person'" ? Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate. '"Use'" ? As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the Work as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format. This includes the right to sublicense the Work. '"Work'" ? Means either or both of the Database and Data offered under the terms of this Document. '"You'" ? the Person acquiring rights under the licence elements of this Document. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. 2.0 What this document covers 2.1. Legal effect of this Document. This Document is: a. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work; and b. A licence of Copyright and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver. 2.2. Legal rights covered. a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on the jurisdiction and type of Data; and b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re- utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright. 2.2 Rights not covered. a. This Document does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the Database; b. This Document does not cover any patents over the Data or the Database. Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document for further details; and c. This Document does not cover any trade marks associated with the Database. Please see Section 4.3 later in this Document for further details. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. 2.3 Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This Document however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the Work by Copyright, and to cover any information protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work. Part II: Dedication to the public domain 3.0 Dedication, waiver, and licence of Copyright and Database Rights 3.1 Dedication of Copyright and Database Rights to the public domain. The Rightsholder by using this Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain for the benefit of the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work. a. The Rightsholder realises that once these rights are relinquished, that the Rightsholder has no further rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work, and that the Work is free and open for others to Use. b. The Rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of rights covers all their heirs and successors. The above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future. 3.2 Waiver of rights and claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1 dedication inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the future over the Work in: a. Copyright; and b. Database Rights. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future. The Rightsholder agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce them over the Work. 3.3 Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when Sections 3.1 and 3.2 inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and You agree as follows: a. The Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future. 3.4 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author��s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment: a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Work and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over the copyrighted aspects of the Work. Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some jurisdictions. 4.0 Relationship to other rights 4.1 No other contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available to You without any other contractual obligations, either express or implied. Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not a contract and does not form part of this Document. 4.2 Relationship to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any patents that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. 4.3 Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not grant You a licence for any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own or that the Rightsholder may use to cover the Work. Users of this Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licences. Part III: General provisions 5.0 Warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability 5.1 The Work is provided by the Rightsholder '"as is'" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You. 5.2 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this Document, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Rightsholder or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 5.3 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the Rightsholder. 6.0 General 6.1 If any provision of this Document is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the cvalidity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Document. 6.2 This Document is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work covered here. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. 6.3 This Document does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Work, including (for jurisdictions where this Document is a licence) fair dealing, fair use, database exceptions, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. 6.4 This Document takes effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the Document terms are sought to be enforced. If the rights waived or granted under applicable law in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not waived or granted under this Document, these additional rights are included in this Document in order to meet the intent of this Document."

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ========================== Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido is Python''s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. The last version released from CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software. Python 1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI. In 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. Python 2.0 was the first and only release from BeOpen.com. Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public License (GPL) was very desirable. CNRI and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the Python license. Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6, with a few minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables later versions to be GPL-compatible. Python 2.0.1 is a derivative work of Python 1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0. After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations. All intellectual property added from this point on, including Python 2.0.1 and its alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software Foundation. See http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about the PSF. Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido''s direction to make these releases possible. B.

Subject to the terms of this License and any third party intellectual property claims, for the duration of intellectual property protections inherent in the Original Code, SGI hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to do the following: (i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI, to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, and, to the extent applicable, display and perform the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI alone and/or as part of a Larger Work; and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. Recipient accepts the terms and conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned actions. The patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the time any related Modification is added, such addition of the Modification causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Modification. No patent license is provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code and Modifications not provided by SGI. 2.2.Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and any third party intellectual property claims, Recipient hereby grants SGI and any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, under any Recipient Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. 2.3.No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of the algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any Modifications provided by SGI . 3.Redistributions. 3.1.Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral where the Recipient.s rights relating to Covered Code are described. Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code. 3.2.Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any of SGI.s rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient.s role as licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient.s choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI in this License. 3.3.Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms Recipient offers. 4.Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive. 5.No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI.

There are various worldwide laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws, regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject. 7.Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party''s intellectual property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim. 8.Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 9.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

The licences which components of this software fall under are as follows. First, we will summarize and say that all components are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that. OpenSSH contains no GPL code. 1) * Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland * All rights reserved * * As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software * can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is * incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be * called by a name other than '"ssh'" or '"Secure Shell'". [Tatu continues] * However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that * are not under my direct control. As far as I know, all included * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most * restrictive); see below for details. [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e., - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL - Zlib is now external, in a library - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included - TSS has been removed - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library [The licence continues] Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide. More information can be found e.g. at '"http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto'". The legal status of this program is some combination of all these permissions and restrictions. Use only at your own responsibility. You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM '"AS IS'" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 2) The 32-bit CRC compensation attack detector in deattack.c was contributed by CORE SDI S.A. under a BSD-style license. * Cryptographic attack detector for ssh - source code * * Copyright (c) 1998 CORE SDI S.A., Buenos Aires, Argentina. * * All rights reserved.
